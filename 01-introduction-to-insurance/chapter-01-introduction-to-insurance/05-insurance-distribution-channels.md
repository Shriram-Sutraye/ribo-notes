> **Timestamp:** ~10:59 - 16:30 in the video

This section covers **how insurance is sold and distributed** in Canada - the different systems and players involved in getting insurance from the company to you.

---

## 🎯 The Big Picture

> 🎯 **Plain English:** There are different ways to BUY insurance. You can go directly to an insurance company, use a broker who shops around for you, or work with an agent. Each has pros and cons. This section explains all the ways insurance gets from the company to your hands.

## 📊 2 Main Ways to Distribute Insurance (+ Agency System)

### 1️⃣ Direct Writer

**The insurance company sells its own products DIRECTLY to consumers.**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Who Sells** | Insurance company sells its OWN products |
| **Sales Force** | Company has its own employees (called "producers") |
| **Compensation** | Salary, bonus, commissions, or a mix |
| **Who Owns Clients** | The INSURER owns the book of business & handles admin |

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "With the direct writer system, the insurance company sells its own products direct to consumer. So that means the insurance company has its own sales force, selling its own products, but any clients brought in by the salesman belongs to the insurance company."

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Think of buying a car directly from the Toyota dealership. You're buying Toyota brand, from Toyota employees, and you're Toyota's customer. 
>
> **Same with Direct Writers:** You call Intact directly, speak to an Intact employee, buy an Intact policy. Simple. But you're ONLY getting Intact options - they won't tell you if a competitor has a better deal.
>
> **Key thing:** The salesperson is an EMPLOYEE. If they quit, you're still Intact's customer - your file doesn't leave with them.

### 2️⃣ Independent Broker

**Represents MORE than one insurance company, gets paid via commissions.**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Who They Represent** | Multiple insurance companies (1+ insurers) |
| **Ownership** | Broker is NOT an employee - owns their own business |
| **Expenses** | Broker pays their own personal/business expenses |
| **Who Owns Clients** | The BROKER owns the clients |
| **Powers** | Some underwriting, quoting, and claims power |

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "The broker represents more than one insurance company and they get paid via commissions. Any clients brought in by the broker belong to the broker."

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Think of a real estate agent who can show you ANY house on the market, not just one builder's homes.
>
> **Same with Brokers:** They work for YOU, not the insurance company. They can shop around, get quotes from Intact, Aviva, Co-operators, etc., and find you the best deal.
>
> **Key thing:** If your broker changes companies, YOUR FILE goes with them! You're the broker's client, not Intact's client.
>
> **The catch:** Brokers don't work for free - they get a commission when you buy. But competition means they're incentivized to find you good deals so you stay with them.

### 3️⃣ Agency System (Bonus Method)

**Agents are small business owners who typically represent ONE insurance company.**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Status** | Considered small business owners |
| **Compensation** | Paid via commissions |
| **Who They Represent** | Typically **ONE insurance company** + Facility Association |
| **Who Owns Clients** | Agent owns their own book of business |

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "With the agency system, all the agents are considered small business owners. Agents get paid via commissions and they own their own book of business. But typically, they only represent one insurance company as well as the Facility Association."

> 🎯 **Plain English:** It's like being a franchise owner - you own your own McDonald's, you're your own boss, BUT you only sell McDonald's food, not Burger King.
>
> **Same with Agency System:** You're an independent business owner, you own your client relationships, BUT you typically only sell ONE company's products (like just State Farm, or just Co-operators).
>
> **Why also Facility Association?** Because some clients are "high-risk" and the main company won't insure them. The agent can still help them through the Facility Association (explained below).

> 🇨🇦 **Canadian Examples from Transcript:**
> - State Farm
> - Co-operators

## 📋 Side-by-Side Comparison

| Feature | Direct Writer | Independent Broker | Agency System |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Works for** | Insurance company (employee) | Themselves (business owner) | Themselves (business owner) |
| **Represents** | ONE company (their employer) | MULTIPLE companies | ONE company + Facility Association |
| **Paid by** | Salary/bonus/commission | Commission | Commission |
| **Owns clients?** | No - insurer owns | Yes - broker owns | Yes - agent owns |
| **Example** | Calling Intact directly | Using a local insurance brokerage | State Farm agent |

> 🎯 **Plain English Summary:**
> - **Direct Writer** = You're talking to the company directly. Simple, but no price comparison.
> - **Independent Broker** = Your personal shopper. Shops around for you, finds best deal. You're their client.
> - **Agency System** = Like a franchise owner. Independent, but locked into one brand.

## 🏢 Managing General Agents (MGAs)

**Wholesalers/intermediaries between insurance companies and brokers.**

### What Are MGAs?

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Role** | Middleman between insurers and brokers |
| **Powers** | Underwriting abilities, can settle claims sometimes, can appoint brokerages |
| **Specialty** | Usually have specialized expertise or access to specialized products (often E&O/professional liability) |

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "These are essentially wholesalers or intermediaries between insurance and brokers. MGAs have certain powers like underwriting abilities, they can settle claims sometimes and even appoint brokerages to sell their products. They usually have some specialized expertise or access to some specialized products, typically in the E&O or professional liability space."

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Imagine you're a small grocery store and you want to sell Coca-Cola, but Coca-Cola only gives distribution deals to HUGE chains. What do you do? You go through a WHOLESALER who buys from Coca-Cola and then sells to small stores like you.
>
> **Same with MGAs:** Small brokerages might not have enough business volume for big insurance companies to give them a direct contract. So they go through an MGA who aggregates multiple small brokerages together.

### Why Do MGAs Exist?

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "If you don't have enough volume, insurance companies are not going to give you contracts to sell their policies. So you can access those same insurers through MGAs who act as wholesalers to aggregate demand. If one broker doesn't have enough business, one MGA can sell to five brokerages and together those five will have enough volume to provide the insurance company."

> 🎯 **Plain English Example:**
> - Broker A alone = Too small for Intact to care
> - Broker B alone = Too small for Intact to care
> - Broker C alone = Too small for Intact to care
> - **MGA combines A + B + C** = NOW Intact is interested because together they bring big volume!

### MGA Structures:

| Structure | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Independent Brokerage** | Sells from 2+ insurance companies, gets commissions |
| **Independent Agency** | Sells from only ONE company, owned by agents, owns book of business |

> ⚠️ **Important:** Every working member of an MGA must have a broker's license, just like a regular broker.

### 2026 Update - Ontario MGA Regulations:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **New Ontario MGA Regulations (June 1, 2026):** New licensing framework for life and health MGAs. Must implement compliance systems and adhere to new standards. Goal = more transparency and consumer protection.

## 🌍 Lloyd's of London

**A marketplace for insuring the UNINSURABLE - the weird, complex, and massive risks.**

### What Is Lloyd's?

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Their role is typically to ensure the stuff that is uninsurable in normal markets. Through Lloyd's of London, you can ensure all kinds of stuff - battleships, cruise ships, satellites, they insure all the weird stuff. But they're not actually an insurance company - they're actually a group of underwriters who assume risk for themselves."

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **What They Insure** | Battleships, cruise ships, satellites, "weird stuff" |
| **What They Are** | NOT an insurance company - a group of underwriters |
| **Who Can Join** | Anyone who meets the financial requirements |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Imagine you want to insure a $500 million cruise ship. No single insurance company wants to risk that much. So you go to Lloyd's - a MARKETPLACE where multiple rich investors (underwriters) each agree to cover a piece of the risk.
>
> It's like crowdfunding, but for insurance. Instead of one company saying "I'll cover all $500M," twenty different underwriters each say "I'll cover $25M."

### Key Terms Explained:

#### Syndicates

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "A syndicate is actually a group of underwriters. The underwriting agent manages the syndicate and appoints who's called a lead underwriter, who is an expert in that class of business."

| Term | What It Means |
|------|---------------|
| **Syndicate** | A group of underwriters pooling together |
| **Underwriting Agent** | Manages the syndicate |
| **Lead Underwriter** | Expert in that specific type of insurance |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** A syndicate is like a team. If you're insuring oil rigs, the lead underwriter is an oil rig insurance expert who leads the team.

#### Coverholders

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Coverholders are basically independent companies worldwide that are authorized by Lloyd's syndicates to underwrite contracts. This allows Lloyd's syndicates to operate globally on a more cost-effective basis."

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Lloyd's is based in London, but they want to sell insurance worldwide. Instead of opening offices everywhere, they AUTHORIZE local companies called "coverholders" to sell on their behalf. 
>
> Think of it like McDonald's franchising instead of owning every restaurant.

**What Coverholders Can Do:**
- Issue documents
- Bind coverage (make it official)
- Collect premiums
- Settle claims
- Write business (within tight limits called "delegated authority")

#### Subscription Policies

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "A subscription policy exists when there's one or more syndicate or one or more insurance company participating in an insurance contract. This is useful because sometimes a risk is too big for one syndicate or one insurer to take on."

**The $100M Tower Example:**

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Let's say you want to ensure a tower valued at $100 million. It'll be very rare to find one insurance company willing to risk $100 million in one insurance policy. And so they might say, okay, I want to insure this property, but I only want to insure 20% of it. So you have 20% subscribed and you need to find other syndicates or other insurers to take on the rest of the risk."

> 🎯 **Plain English:** 
> - You need $100M coverage for your skyscraper
> - Insurer A says: "I'll take 20%" (= $20M)
> - Insurer B says: "I'll take 30%" (= $30M)
> - Insurer C says: "I'll take 50%" (= $50M)
> - Total = 100% covered!
>
> The one who takes the BIGGEST piece = the "lead insurer." Everyone else "subscribes" to follow them.

#### Manuscript Policies

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "These are tailor-made policies that are made specifically for a complex or unique risk. It's almost like a custom insurance policy."

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Off-the-shelf policies don't fit your weird situation? Lloyd's will literally WRITE A CUSTOM POLICY just for you. Like getting a suit tailored vs. buying off the rack.

### How Business is Placed at Lloyd's:

```
1. Producer (salesperson) provides underwriting info on a "SLIP" (the application)

2. Underwriters review and either DECLINE or ACCEPT

3. Underwriters commit to a PERCENTAGE of the risk until 100% subscribed

4. Once fully subscribed → sent to Lloyd's Policy Signing Office → made official!
```

> 🎯 **Plain English:** It's like passing around a sign-up sheet. Each underwriter writes their name and what percentage they'll cover. Once the sheet hits 100%, the deal is done.

## 🚗 Facility Association

**The "insurer of last resort" for high-risk drivers who can't get normal insurance.**

### What Is It?

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Agents typically only represent one insurance company as well as the Facility Association."

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Some drivers are SO risky (DUIs, multiple accidents, cancelled policies) that NO regular insurance company will touch them. But you LEGALLY need car insurance to drive. So what do you do?
>
> Enter the **Facility Association** - they GUARANTEE you can get insurance, even if you're a terrible driver. But you'll pay A LOT for it.

### Who Ends Up Here?

| Reason | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Multiple at-fault accidents | 3 crashes in 2 years |
| Serious tickets | DUI, reckless driving |
| No driving history | Brand new driver with no record |
| Policy cancelled | Non-payment, fraud |
| High-risk vehicle | Sports car with bad claim history |

### Key Facts:

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Cost** | 2-3x MORE expensive than regular insurance ($8,000-$10,000/year) |
| **Who runs it** | Non-profit association of all licensed insurers |
| **Where available** | AB, NB, NL, NT, NS, NU, ON, PE, YT |
| **NOT available** | BC, MB, SK (government insurance in those provinces) |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** It's insurance jail. You end up there because no one else wants you. It's expensive and not fun, but at least you can legally drive. The goal is to improve your record and eventually escape back to normal insurance.
