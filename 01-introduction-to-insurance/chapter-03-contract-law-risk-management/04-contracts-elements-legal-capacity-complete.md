This section covers **contracts** (express vs implied), **duty of care**, the **5 elements of all contracts**, **legal capacity requirements**, the **3 special elements for insurance contracts**, **void vs voidable**, and **breach of contract remedies**.

---

## 🎯 The Big Picture

> 🎯 **Plain English:** A contract is a promise that the law will enforce. But not every promise is a valid contract! This section teaches you what makes a contract legally binding, who can (and can't) enter into contracts, and what happens when someone breaks a contract.

---

## 📜 Part 1: What is a Contract?

> 💡 **From Transcript (1529s-1537s):** "Now let's talk about contracts. A contract is a legally enforceable agreement for somebody to do or not do something. We have two types of contracts, we have expressed contracts and implied contracts."

### Definition:

| Contract |
|----------|
| A **legally enforceable agreement** for someone to DO or NOT DO something |

---

## 📝 Two Types of Contracts

### 1️⃣ Express Contracts

> 💡 **From Transcript (1542s-1555s):** "Express contracts are legally binding agreements between two parties with terms defined in writing. For example, an insurance policy would be an example of an express contract. All the terms are expressly laid out."

| Express Contract |
|-----------------|
| Terms defined **in writing** |
| Clear and explicit |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Insurance Policy

| Example | Type |
|---------|------|
| Insurance policy | Express contract |
| **Why?** | All terms are expressly laid out |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If you can read all the terms on paper, it's an express contract.

---

### 2️⃣ Implied Contracts

> 💡 **From Transcript (1555s-1576s):** "The second type is implied contracts. These can be oral or non-written agreements that can be inferred through behaviours or other circumstances that indicate that there is an agreement. So this is often pretty ambiguous in nature, but it has the same implications and is just as valid as express contracts."

| Implied Contract |
|-----------------|
| Oral or non-written |
| Inferred from behaviour |
| Just as valid as express! |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Ordering Takeout

> 💡 **From Transcript (1576s-1588s):** "For example, when you order take out, you don't explicitly say that you have to pay when you pick it up, but there's an implied agreement that when you pick it up, you pay for it."

| Example | Type |
|---------|------|
| Order takeout | Implied contract |
| **Why?** | You didn't sign anything, but you WILL pay |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** You order pizza, they make it, you pay when you pick it up. No one signed anything, but everyone knows the deal!

---

## ⚖️ Part 2: Legally Enforceable

> 💡 **From Transcript (1588s-1618s):** "When a contract is considered legally enforceable, that means the courts have agreed to enforce the terms of the contract. Meaning they will step in to force the performance of the obligation."

### What Does "Legally Enforceable" Mean?

| Definition |
|------------|
| Courts will **enforce** the contract terms |
| Courts will **force** performance of obligations |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Construction Company

> 💡 **From Transcript (1599s-1618s):** "For example, if you contract with a construction company to build you a house and they build you house, but you don't pay them. And if the contract is legally enforceable, the construction company can go to the court and the court can force you to perform your obligation, meaning to pay the construction company."

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Construction builds house | You must pay |
| You don't pay | They go to court |
| Court orders | You MUST pay them |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If you don't hold up your end of the deal, the court will MAKE you!

---

## 🛡️ Part 3: Duty of Care

> 💡 **From Transcript (1618s-1628s):** "In liability terms, we also all have what's called a duty of care. That is a requirement that we act responsibly in a way that avoids hurting other people."

### Definition:

| Duty of Care |
|--------------|
| Requirement to act **responsibly** |
| Avoid hurting other people |

---

### General Duty of Care

> 💡 **From Transcript (1628s-1656s):** "So this can be a general duty of care, meaning you have to take reasonable care to avoid causing foreseeable harm to other people."

| General Duty |
|--------------|
| Take **reasonable care** |
| Avoid **foreseeable harm** |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Wet Floor Sign

> 💡 **From Transcript (1636s-1656s):** "Common example of this, and you see this in stores and in malls all the time. When the janitor is mopping, they'll usually have a wet floor sign. So that is an example of them taking reasonable steps to avoid causing foreseeable harm. Right, the harm of somebody slipping and falling on the wet floor."

| Scenario | Duty Fulfilled |
|----------|----------------|
| Janitor mopping | Put up wet floor sign |
| Foreseeable harm | Slipping and falling |
| Reasonable step | Warning sign |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If you mop the floor and don't put up a sign, someone could slip. You KNEW this could happen - that's foreseeable harm. The sign is reasonable care.

---

### Specific Duty of Care

> 💡 **From Transcript (1656s-1675s):** "There's also specific duties of care. So certain relationships will involve a higher level of responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of the other party. For example, in a doctor patient relationship or an employer employee relationship."

| Specific Duty |
|---------------|
| **Higher** level of responsibility |
| Applies to special relationships |

### 📋 Transcript Examples:

| Relationship | Duty Level |
|--------------|------------|
| Doctor → Patient | Higher duty |
| Employer → Employee | Higher duty |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** A doctor has MORE responsibility to protect a patient than a stranger on the street. Same with your boss protecting you at work.

---

## 📋 Part 4: Five Elements of a Contract

> 💡 **From Transcript (1675s-1689s):** "Now let's talk about the elements of a contract. For a contract to be legally enforceable, it has to have five key elements. Agreement, genuine intentions, consideration, the legality of object, and the legal capacity of the parties."

### The 5 Elements:

| # | Element | What It Means |
|---|---------|---------------|
| 1 | **Agreement** | Offer made and accepted |
| 2 | **Genuine Intention** | All parties freely entered |
| 3 | **Consideration** | Everyone brings value |
| 4 | **Legality of Object** | Purpose is legal |
| 5 | **Legal Capacity** | Parties can legally contract |

---

### 1️⃣ Agreement

> 💡 **From Transcript (1689s-1699s):** "So the first is agreement. That means there was an offer made and the offer was accepted. All terms have been agreed to and there are no further negotiations."

| Agreement |
|-----------|
| Offer made ✓ |
| Offer accepted ✓ |
| All terms agreed ✓ |
| No more negotiations ✓ |

---

### 2️⃣ Genuine Intention

> 💡 **From Transcript (1699s-1717s):** "The second is genuine intention, which means all parties have freely entered into the contract and are aware of all the terms. There's full honesty and disclosure happening here. So there's no fraud, no duress, no concealment, and they did not enter into the contract as a mistake."

| Genuine Intention |
|-------------------|
| Freely entered ✓ |
| Aware of all terms ✓ |
| No fraud ✓ |
| No duress ✓ |
| No concealment ✓ |
| No mistake ✓ |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Nobody was lied to, forced, or tricked into signing.

---

### 3️⃣ Consideration

> 💡 **From Transcript (1717s-1742s):** "Thirdly is consideration. Meaning all parties bring something of value to the contract so that everyone benefits. In the example of an insurance contract, you're paying them a premium for the promise of protection. So an insurance policy is valid as long as there is an intent to pay even if you haven't actually paid for the contract yet."

| Consideration |
|---------------|
| Everyone brings **value** |
| Everyone **benefits** |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Insurance Premium

| Party | Brings |
|-------|--------|
| **Insured** | Premium (money) |
| **Insurer** | Promise of protection |
| **Key point** | Intent to pay = valid (even if not paid yet!) |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** You give money, they give protection. Both sides get something!

---

### 4️⃣ Legality of Object

> 💡 **From Transcript (1742s-1765s):** "Fourth, we have the legality of object, meaning that the purpose of the contract is legal. So the purpose of the contract is not something that is contrary to the public good. So if you've signed a contract to deliver some drugs or to commit some kind of crime, that contract is not legally enforceable because the purpose of the contract is illegal."

| Legality of Object |
|-------------------|
| Purpose must be **legal** |
| Not contrary to public good |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Drug Delivery

| Contract Purpose | Enforceable? |
|------------------|--------------|
| Deliver drugs | ❌ NO - illegal |
| Commit a crime | ❌ NO - illegal |
| Sell insurance | ✅ YES - legal |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** You can't have a legally enforceable contract to do something illegal. Courts won't help you enforce a drug deal!

---

### 5️⃣ Legal Capacity

> 💡 **From Transcript (1765s-1784s):** "And lastly, we have the legal capacity of the parties, which means that all parties have to understand the obligations that they are taking on and can legally sue or be sued."

| Legal Capacity |
|----------------|
| Understand obligations |
| Can sue or be sued |

---

## 👤 Part 5: Who Has Legal Capacity?

### ❌ Limited Capacity Groups:

#### Minors

> 💡 **From Transcript (1784s-1800s):** "So for minors, they can contract for necessities only, meaning for food, clothing, shelter. Even if a minor has to go and purchase an insurance policy, you have to ensure the minor understands the terms of the insurance policy."

| Minors |
|--------|
| Can contract for **necessities only** |
| Food, clothing, shelter |
| Must understand terms |

---

#### Mental Incompetence

> 💡 **From Transcript (1800s-1809s):** "Next we have mental incompetence. These people have no legal capacity and therefore cannot legally enter into any contracts."

| Mental Incompetence |
|--------------------|
| **NO legal capacity** |
| Cannot enter contracts |

---

#### Persons Under Influence

> 💡 **From Transcript (1809s-1819s):** "Next we have persons under the influence of drugs and alcohol, similar to the people that are mentally incompetent, they have no legal capacity."

| Under Influence |
|-----------------|
| Drugs or alcohol |
| **NO legal capacity** |

---

#### Trade Names

> 💡 **From Transcript (1819s-1867s):** "Next we have trade names. Trade names by themselves cannot enter into contracts because they have no legal status. They have to be attached to a legal entity. So for example, if my name is Ron Butler and I operate a painting company under the name Best Painters, by itself Best Painters cannot enter into any contracts because it has no legal status. Best Painters cannot be sued or sue other people. However, Ron Butler DBA Best Painters, now because the trade name is attached to a legal person that can be sued or sue other people, then it can enter into contracts."

### 📋 Transcript Example: Ron Butler / Best Painters

| Entity | Can Contract? |
|--------|---------------|
| "Best Painters" alone | ❌ NO - no legal status |
| "Ron Butler" alone | ✅ YES - legal person |
| "Ron Butler DBA Best Painters" | ✅ YES - trade name attached to legal person |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** The business NAME can't sign contracts - but the PERSON behind the name can!

---

### ✅ Full Capacity Groups:

#### Corporations, Sole Proprietorships, Partnerships

> 💡 **From Transcript (1870s-1886s):** "And lastly we have corporations or sole proprietorship or partnerships. These are considered legal entities that can sue or be sued and therefore can enter into contracts."

| Entity Type | Can Contract? |
|-------------|---------------|
| Corporation | ✅ YES |
| Sole Proprietorship | ✅ YES |
| Partnership | ✅ YES |

---

## 🏛️ Part 6: Three Special Elements for Insurance Contracts

> 💡 **From Transcript (1886s-1901s):** "So all contracts have to meet those five requirements we discussed previously. When it comes to insurance contracts, there are three more elements that are special to insurance contracts and have to be present for the insurance contract to be legally enforceable."

### Insurance Needs 5 + 3 = 8 Elements!

| Regular Contract | Insurance Contract |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| 5 elements | 5 + 3 = 8 elements |

---

### 1️⃣ Insurable Interest

> 💡 **From Transcript (1901s-1937s):** "The first is insurable interest. Only those who actually suffer a loss are entitled to benefit from the policy. For example, the owner of a property, the mortgagee, a bailee or anyone who is held legally responsible for third party injury. This helps prevent insurance fraud and helps prevent people from profiting from insurance."

| Insurable Interest |
|-------------------|
| Must actually **suffer a loss** to benefit |
| Prevents fraud and profiting |

### Who Has Insurable Interest?

| Person | Why |
|--------|-----|
| Property owner | Would suffer if damaged |
| Mortgagee (bank) | Has money at stake |
| Bailee | Responsible for property |
| Third-party liable | Legally responsible |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Can't Insure Someone Else's Home

> 💡 **From Transcript (1921s-1937s):** "For example, I would not be able to take out an insurance policy on your home because I have no insurable interest in your home. If your home was to burn down or something was to happen to it, I would not suffer any financial loss. Therefore I have no insurable interest in your home and I am unable to insure it."

| Scenario | Insurable? |
|----------|------------|
| Insure YOUR OWN home | ✅ YES |
| Insure SOMEONE ELSE'S home | ❌ NO |
| **Why?** | You don't suffer if it burns |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** You can't take out insurance on a stranger's house and hope it burns down. That would be fraud!

---

### 2️⃣ Indemnity

> 💡 **From Transcript (1937s-1956s):** "The next is indemnity. This establishes the amount of entitlement. So how much do you actually get in the event of a loss scenario? Remember that the principle of indemnity states that you would be paid the actual amount of loss only to make you whole again. No more. No less."

| Indemnity |
|-----------|
| Paid **actual amount of loss** |
| Made **whole again** |
| **No more, no less** |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Insurance puts you back where you were - not better off, not worse off. Just whole again.

---

### 3️⃣ Utmost Good Faith

> 💡 **From Transcript (1956s-1986s):** "And lastly, we have utmost good faith. This states that both parties must be open, honest, and comply with all the policy terms and conditions. So for example, from the insurers, they are responsible for properly managing the premium pool. For the insured, that means that all the statements they made are true and they are exercising honesty with regards to reporting losses."

| Utmost Good Faith |
|-------------------|
| **Both parties** must be honest |
| Comply with all terms |

| Party | Responsibility |
|-------|----------------|
| **Insurer** | Properly manage premium pool |
| **Insured** | True statements, honest loss reporting |

---

## 🚫 Part 7: Void vs Voidable

> 💡 **From Transcript (1986s-2044s):** "When it comes to insurance contracts, you have to meet both those five requirements of all contracts as well as these three elements that are special to insurance in order for the insurance policy to be valid. Otherwise, it's treated as void, meaning it's treated as if it never existed."

### Void

| Void |
|------|
| Contract **never existed** |
| Missing essential elements |

### Voidable

> 💡 **From Transcript (2004s-2044s):** "There's also a concept called voidable. So if any of these elements are missing from a regular contract or insurance contract, the policy can be voidable, meaning the wronged party can choose to void the policy or not."

| Voidable |
|----------|
| Wronged party can CHOOSE to void |
| OR keep the contract |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Signing While Intoxicated

> 💡 **From Transcript (2016s-2044s):** "For example, if I signed a business deal over dinner while I was heavily intoxicated, because I was a person under the influence of alcohol at the time, I did not have legal capacity to enter into a contract. So if I sober up the next day and I review the contract, that contract is voidable, meaning I can void it if I wish or if now while sober I still like the terms of the contract, I can keep it and proceed with it."

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Signed while drunk | No legal capacity |
| Sober up next day | Contract is **voidable** |
| Option 1 | Void it (cancel) |
| Option 2 | Keep it (if you like terms) |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** You got drunk and signed something bad? You can cancel it. Got drunk and signed something good? Keep it!

---

## ⚖️ Part 8: Breach of Contract & Remedies

> 💡 **From Transcript (2050s-2073s):** "A breach of contract results when there's a failure to keep any promise that forms part or all of the contract, meaning you have failed to live up to the obligations of the contract. When it comes to breach of contract, actions must be taken within a limit of time. So there's usually a statute of limitation on when you can bring up cases for breach of contract."

### What is Breach?

| Breach of Contract |
|-------------------|
| Failure to keep a promise |
| Failed to meet obligations |
| Statute of limitations applies |

---

### Remedies (What Courts Can Do)

> 💡 **From Transcript (2073s-2114s):** "Typically you would go to court to get your remedies. This can involve compensating the injured party for damages, rescinding the contract and restoring the parties to their pre-contract positions, meaning we just pretend the contract never existed in the first place. You can issue an injunction to prevent a party from doing something or to force them to do something."

| Remedy | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Damages** | Compensate injured party |
| **Rescind** | Cancel contract, restore to pre-contract |
| **Injunction** | Force or prevent an action |
| **Mandate fulfillment** | Court orders completion |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Injunction - Competing Business

> 💡 **From Transcript (2094s-2109s):** "For example, you can force them to build the home that you paid them to build. Or for example, if you had a contract that prevented a competing business from opening within a certain radius of your business, you could file that injunction to prevent them from moving near you."

| Scenario | Injunction Type |
|----------|-----------------|
| Builder won't build | Force them to complete |
| Competitor moves too close | Prevent them from opening |

---

## 📝 Part 9: Changing Insurance Contracts

> 💡 **From Transcript (2129s):** "When it comes to changing an insurance contract, this is usually done via documents, so it has to be done in writing and both parties must agree to it."

| Changing Contracts |
|-------------------|
| Must be in **writing** |
| **Both parties** must agree |
