## 👨‍⚕️ Professional Liability Introduction (1010.656s - 1044.185s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1010.656s-1017.218s):** "Now, there are some liability exposures that even the CGL would not cover you for. The first category I want to talk about is professional liability insurance."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1017.218s-1025.54s):** "If you are a professional, you need to purchase special liability insurance on top of your CGL."

| Professional Liability |
|-----------------------|
| CGL does NOT cover professionals |
| Need SPECIAL liability insurance |
| ON TOP of CGL (not instead of) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> CGL is great for most businesses, but if you're a PROFESSIONAL (someone giving expert advice or services), you need EXTRA coverage. CGL covers physical injuries and property damage—but what about bad ADVICE? That's where professional liability comes in.

### Who Is a "Professional"? (1026.78s - 1044.185s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1026.78s-1031.141s):** "A professional is defined as anyone with specialized knowledge or training."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1031.141s-1038.103s):** "These people would have a higher standard duty of care to reflect their years of training."

| What Makes Someone a Professional |
|----------------------------------|
| **Specialized knowledge** or training |
| **Higher standard** of duty of care |
| Clients rely on their EXPERTISE |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> A "professional" is anyone who went through special training to gain expertise:
> - Doctors spent years in medical school
> - Lawyers passed the bar exam
> - Engineers got licensed
> 
> Because they have SPECIAL knowledge, the law holds them to HIGHER standards. If they mess up, they're MORE liable than a regular person would be.

## 👨‍⚕️ Two Classes of Professionals (1038.103s - 1057.868s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1038.103s-1044.185s):** "There are two major classes of professionals in the insurance industry. You have healthcare professionals and consultant or advice professionals."

| Two Professional Classes |
|-------------------------|
| **1. Healthcare Professionals** |
| **2. Consultant/Advice Professionals** |

---

### Class 1: Healthcare Professionals → Malpractice (1044.905s - 1057.868s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1044.905s-1048.706s):** "Healthcare professionals deal with medical conditions."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1048.706s-1052.267s):** "They would purchase something called the malpractice liability insurance."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1052.267s-1057.868s):** "This insurance protects them against legal liability for rendering or failing to render proper professional services."

| Healthcare → Malpractice Insurance |
|-----------------------------------|
| Who: Doctors, nurses, dentists, surgeons |
| Coverage: **Malpractice liability** |
| Protects against: Wrong treatment or failing to treat |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> If you work in healthcare, you need MALPRACTICE insurance. This covers:
> - Misdiagnosis (said it was a cold, was actually cancer)
> - Wrong treatment (prescribed wrong medication)
> - Failing to act (should've ordered a test but didn't)
> 
> Patients can sue for millions if you mess up their health!

---

### Class 2: Advice Professionals → Errors & Omissions (1059.389s - 1083.435s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1059.389s-1063.35s):** "As an advice professional or a consultant, clients depend on you for your accurate advice."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1063.35s-1070.111s):** "Examples of advice professionals include insurance brokers, accountants, engineers, and lawyers."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1070.991s-1074.752s):** "These group of people would purchase errors and omissions insurance."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1074.752s-1080.514s):** "This insurance protects them against any liability arising out of rendering or failing to render proper professional services."

| Advice Professionals → E&O Insurance |
|-------------------------------------|
| Who: Brokers, accountants, engineers, lawyers |
| Coverage: **Errors & Omissions (E&O)** |
| Protects: Bad advice or failure to advise |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> If clients come to you for ADVICE, you need E&O insurance:
> - **Insurance broker:** Sold wrong coverage → client has uncovered loss
> - **Accountant:** Made tax error → client owes IRS penalties
> - **Engineer:** Design flaw → building unsafe
> - **Lawyer:** Missed filing deadline → client loses case
> 
> "Errors" = you did something wrong. "Omissions" = you forgot to do something.

> [!NOTE]
> **E&O vs Malpractice - Same Idea!**
> Both E&O and Malpractice cover the same concept: "I messed up my professional duties."
> - Healthcare calls it "Malpractice"
> - Everyone else calls it "Errors & Omissions"

## 🚗 Garage Liability Insurance (1083.435s - 1114.282s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1083.635s-1091.477s):** "The next group is garage liability. Garage liability insurance is for businesses that sell, repair, install, transport, or operate vehicles, whether they own them or not."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1093.557s-1099.479s):** "This type of exposure is not insured by your CGL."

| Garage Liability Insurance |
|---------------------------|
| For businesses dealing with VEHICLES |
| Sell, repair, install, transport, operate |
| Whether they OWN them or not |
| **NOT covered by CGL!** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> If your business involves OTHER PEOPLE'S CARS, you need garage liability:
> - Auto repair shops
> - Car dealerships
> - Body shops
> - Valet parking services
> - Tow truck companies
> 
> CGL doesn't cover this because cars involve HUGE liability risks.

### Who Needs Garage Liability? (1099.479s - 1114.282s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1099.479s-1103.88s):** "Examples of business who would need garage liability insurance include body shops or even valet services."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1103.88s-1110.762s):** "They would purchase something called a standard garage automobile policy."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1110.762s-1114.282s):** "This insures third-party liability and damage to customers' cars caused by negligence."

| Examples & Policy |
|------------------|
| Body shops, valet services |
| Policy: **Standard Garage Automobile Policy** |
| Covers: Third-party liability + customer car damage |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> **Standard Garage Automobile Policy** covers:
> 1. **Third-party liability:** Valet hits a pedestrian with customer's car
> 2. **Customer car damage:** Mechanic scratches a customer's paint while working on it
> 
> Both are covered because they're negligence while handling customer vehicles.
