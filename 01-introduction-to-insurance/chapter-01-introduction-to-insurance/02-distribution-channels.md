## Overview

Insurance gets from insurers to consumers through **distribution channels**. There are 2 main ways:

| Method | Who Sells |
|--------|-----------|
| **Direct Writer** | Insurer's own employees sell directly to consumers |
| **Independent Broker** | Independent businesses sell from multiple insurers |

Plus two important variations:
- **Agency System** (exclusive agents for 1 insurer)
- **MGA** (wholesalers between insurers and brokers)

---

## 1️⃣ Direct Writer (D2C = Direct to Consumer)

**Definition:** The **insurer** sells its own products **directly** to consumers using its own **employees**.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Who sells** | Employees of the insurer (called "Producers") |
| **Products** | Only that insurer's products |
| **Compensation** | Salary, bonus, commissions, or a mix |
| **Who owns the clients** | The **insurer** owns the book of business |
| **Admin** | Insurer handles all administration |

### Pros and Cons:

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Streamlined experience | Limited product selection |
| One company, one contact | Can't shop around for best price |
| May have lower overhead costs | No independent advice |

> 💡 **Example:** Belairdirect, Sonnet — you buy online directly from them, no broker involved.

---

## 2️⃣ Independent Broker (What YOU'RE Training For!)

**Definition:** A **licensed professional** who represents **more than 1 insurer** and earns commission on sales.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Who sells** | Licensed brokers (NOT employees of insurer) |
| **Products** | Multiple insurers' products |
| **Compensation** | Commission from insurers |
| **Expenses** | Broker pays their own expenses |
| **Who owns the clients** | The **BROKER** owns the clients! |
| **Powers** | May have some underwriting, quoting, claims authority |

### Why Clients Love Brokers:

| Benefit | How It Helps Client |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Choice** | Shop multiple insurers for best price/coverage |
| **Advice** | Independent — not biased toward one insurer |
| **Advocacy** | Broker fights for YOU in claims |
| **Expertise** | Can find specialized coverage |

> 💡 **Key Difference:** Clients belong to the BROKER, not the insurer. If you move to a new brokerage, your clients can come with you!

### 2026 Context: Broker Challenges

| Challenge | What's Happening |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Direct writers expanding** | Competing for small business market |
| **Digital-first expectations** | Clients want online quotes, apps |
| **Auto insurance reforms** | July 2026 changes require educating clients |

## 3️⃣ Agency System (Exclusive Agents)

**Definition:** **Small business owners** (agents) who represent **only 1 insurer** + the Facility Association.

| **Product range** | Limited | Wide selection |

### What's Facility Association?

> The **Facility Association** provides auto insurance to people who can't get it in the regular market (high-risk drivers).

| Why Someone Uses Facility | Example |
|---------------------------|---------|
| Multiple accidents | 3 at-fault accidents in 2 years |
| DUI conviction | Impaired driving on record |
| New driver, no history | No insurance experience |
| Policy cancelled | Non-payment, fraud |

> 💡 **Agents represent Facility Association** so they can still help high-risk clients get coverage (at higher premiums).

| 2 | Broker takes slip to Lloyd's underwriters |
| 3 | Underwriters **commit a % of the risk** ("I'll take 20%") |
| 4 | Process continues until slip = **100% subscribed** |
| 5 | Policy is now fully placed! |

> 💡 **Example:** A $10M yacht needs insurance. Syndicate A takes 40%, Syndicate B takes 35%, Syndicate C takes 25%. If the yacht sinks, each pays their % of the claim.
