> **Timestamp:** ~12:50 - 17:25 in the video (769s - 1045s)

This section covers **fraud detection and prevention responsibilities for brokers**, the consequences of fraud, and the detailed requirements for what the insured must provide when filing a claim.

---

## 🎯 The Big Picture

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Fraud is a BIG DEAL in insurance - and as a broker, you're on the front line. This section explains your 4 key responsibilities for dealing with fraud, plus what documentation the insured must provide when they have a loss.

---

## 🚨 Part 1: Fraud (Statutory Condition)

| **Consequence** | Entire claim can be **VOID** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Fraud):**
> "Cheating." If you stage an accident or lie about how much stuff was stolen to get more money, you are committing fraud. If you get caught, the insurance company pays you NOTHING.

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If someone lies to get insurance money, they lose EVERYTHING - the whole claim is voided!

---

## 👔 Broker Responsibilities in Fraud (4 Key Areas)

> 💡 **From Transcript (783s-806s):** "So what are the brokers' responsibilities in the case of fraud? Because insurance brokers are the front line people interacting with the clients directly we play a critical role in detecting, preventing and responding to fraud. So our responsibilities in this case are four folds. So its detection and verification, prevention, reporting and cooperation and ensuring ethical conduct."

| 4 | **Ethical Conduct** | Uphold utmost good faith |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Broker's Fraud Job):**
> As a broker, you are the "Fraud Police." Your job is to spot the lies, stop them before they happen, tell the right people, and always be the "Good Guy."

---

### 1️⃣ Detection & Verification

> 💡 **From Transcript (808s-827s):** "When it comes to detection and verification the broker has to be vigilant and aware of any red flags. For example any unusual claim patterns, suspicious documentation or different things of that nature. We also have to verify client information including identity, addresses as well as cross-check documents for inconsistency."

| Task | How |
|------|-----|
| **Be vigilant** | Watch for red flags |
| **Look for red flags** | Unusual patterns, suspicious docs |
| **Verify client info** | Check identity, addresses |
| **Cross-check documents** | Look for inconsistencies |

| Examples of Red Flags |
|----------------------|
| Unusual claim patterns |
| Suspicious documentation |
| Inconsistent information |
| Frequent claims |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If something feels "off" - too many claims, documents that don't match, weird stories - PAY ATTENTION. Trust your gut!

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Detection):**
> If a client has 3 "accidental" fires in 2 months, that's a Red Flag. Check their ID, check their address, and make sure their story adds up.

---

### 2️⃣ Prevention

> 💡 **From Transcript (827s-855s):** "The next step is prevention. So we need to educate clients about the importance of honest disclosure and the consequences of fraud. We have to follow proper documentation procedures and never allow clients to sign blank applications. Not only is that unethical its risky when it comes to E&O claims. We want to make sure that the client is signing off on all the information that they are providing. Also we have to use a secure system for handling data and processing documents."

| Prevention Task | Action |
|-----------------|--------|
| **Educate clients** | Explain importance of honest disclosure |
| **Explain consequences** | What happens if they commit fraud |
| **NEVER allow blank applications** | Client must sign completed forms |
| **Proper documentation** | Follow procedures |
| **Secure systems** | Protect data and documents |

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL WARNING:**

> 💡 **From Transcript (840s-848s):** "Never allow clients to sign blank applications. Not only is that unethical its risky when it comes to E&O claims. We want to make sure that the client is signing off on all the information that they are providing."

| NEVER DO THIS | Why |
|---------------|-----|
| ❌ Client signs blank application | Unethical + E&O risk! |
| ✅ Client signs COMPLETED application | They're confirming the info |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** NEVER let a client sign an empty application and then fill it in yourself! If something goes wrong, YOU are liable. Make them sign after ALL info is filled in.

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (No Blank Forms):**
> Never, ever say "Just sign here and I'll fill in the rest later." That's a trap for you (the broker). If you make a mistake on that form, it's your fault, and you could be sued!

---

### 3️⃣ Reporting & Cooperation

> 💡 **From Transcript (855s-877s):** "Next comes to reporting and cooperation. If a fraud is suspected, the broker has to immediately report the incident internally to their principal broker or to the insurer, as well as cooperate with any authorities such as insurers or the police. We also have to maintain detailed records of all suspicious interactions and communications with clients."

| If Fraud Suspected | Action |
|-------------------|--------|
| **Report internally** | To your principal broker |
| **Report externally** | To the insurer |
| **Cooperate** | With insurers AND police |
| **Document everything** | Keep detailed records |

| Who to Report To |
|-----------------|
| Principal broker (first!) |
| The insurer |
| Police (if needed) |

> 4. Document EVERYTHING suspicious

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Reporting):**
> If you think a client is lying, don't keep it to yourself. Tell your boss (Principal Broker) first, then tell the insurance company. If it's serious, call the cops!

---

### 4️⃣ Ethical Conduct

> 💡 **From Transcript (877s-894s):** "As brokers, we are held to a high standard of utmost good faith, integrity and fiduciary duty. A breach of these can lead to void policies, denied claims, disciplinary actions against the broker, including suspension or even revocation of your license so they can take your license away. And brokers can also be subject to fines as outlined by the regulations."

| Standard | What It Means |
|----------|---------------|
| **Utmost good faith** | Complete honesty |
| **Integrity** | Do the right thing |
| **Fiduciary duty** | Act in client's best interest with their money |

### Consequences of Breach:

| Consequence | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| **Void policies** | Policy cancelled |
| **Denied claims** | Claims not paid |
| **Disciplinary action** | RIBO investigation |
| **Suspension** | Can't work as broker |
| **License revocation** | License TAKEN AWAY |
| **Fines** | Monetary penalties |

**Don't risk your career!**

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Ethical Consequences):**
> If you help a client cheat, you don't just lose the commission. You could lose your license, pay a huge fine, and never work in insurance again. It's not worth it.

## 📋 Part 2: Requirements Upon Loss

> 💡 **From Transcript (902s-909s):** "So what are your requirements upon loss? The most important thing is that the insured must provide proper documentation."

### The 3 Main Documentation Requirements:

> 💡 **From Transcript (909s-921s):** "That means providing notice of loss as soon as possible in writing. Having proof of loss, which includes details about the loss, as well as provide a statutory declaration as soon as practicable."

| 3 | **Statutory declaration** | As soon as practicable |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Requirements Upon Loss):**
> The "Paperwork Phase." You must send a letter saying what happened (Notice) and then fill out the official "This is exactly what I lost" form (Proof of Loss).

---

## 📝 Proof of Loss Components (7+ Items)

### 1️⃣ Inventory of Damaged Property

> 💡 **From Transcript (921s-929s):** "And so this can involve an inventory of damaged property, including the number, the cash value and the amount that you're claiming."

| Amount claimed |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Inventory):**
> Make a list! "3 Chairs, 1 Table, 1 TV." Write down what they were worth and how much you want the insurer to pay you back.

---

### 2️⃣ How the Loss Occurred

> 💡 **From Transcript (929s-939s):** "The second is how the loss occurred. You have to make a best effort, guess or estimation as to what happened and you must swear that the loss was accidental."

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Best effort explanation** | What happened? |
| **Guess or estimation** | If you don't know exactly |
| **Swear it was accidental** | Confirm not deliberate |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** You have to explain WHAT HAPPENED and swear under oath that you didn't cause it on purpose.

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (How it happened):**
> You have to tell the story. "The grease on the stove caught fire by accident." You have to swear on your life (or a legal document) that you didn't start it on purpose.

---

### 3️⃣ Location at Time of Loss

> 💡 **From Transcript (939s-943s):** "Also location at the time of loss, where was the property at the time of loss?"

| Where was the property when the loss happened? |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Location):**
> "Was the TV actually in the house when it burned?" You have to prove it was at the address you insured it for.

---

### 4️⃣ Other Insurance (Pro-Rata Sharing!)

> 💡 **From Transcript (943s-958s):** "Is there other insurance that might apply? And if so, what are their limits and who are the insurers? Because the policies will pay together, pro-rata versus the total coverage, right? There's sharing of limits. So you're not able to claim separately on two insurance policies and get double the payout."

| What to Disclose |
|-----------------|
| Other insurance that applies |
| Their limits |
| Who the insurers are |

| Key Rule: No Double Dipping! |
|------------------------------|
| ❌ Can't claim on 2 policies and get double |
| ✅ Policies share payment pro-rata |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If you have 2 policies covering the same thing, you don't get paid twice! The insurers split the payment proportionally between them.

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Other Insurance):**
> "No Double Payouts." If your house is worth $100 and you have two $100 policies, you don't get $200. The two companies share the $100 bill.

---

### 5️⃣ Interest of Insured and Others

> 💡 **From Transcript (960s-967s):** "Also interest of the insured and others. Are there other people with insurable interest on the property and at what percentage?"

| What to Disclose |
|-----------------|
| Others with insurable interest |
| Their percentage ownership |

| Leasing company |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Interest):**
> "Who else owns this stuff?" If you are still paying off your car, the bank owns a piece of it. They need to know who gets the check.

---

### 6️⃣ Changes to Property Since Policy Start

> 💡 **From Transcript (967s-978s):** "And also changes in the property since the start of the policy. Are there changes in use, ownership, location, changes in exposures, any material changes you would have to disclose at this point."

| Changes to Disclose |
|--------------------|
| Change in use |
| Change in ownership |
| Change in location |
| Change in exposures |
| Any material changes |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Even if you forgot to report a material change earlier, you MUST disclose it now at claim time!

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Changes):**
> If you turned your house into a store 2 months ago and didn't tell them, you HAVE to tell them now during the claim. (But be warned: they might deny the claim because you didn't tell them sooner!)

---

### 7️⃣ Inventory of Undamaged Property

> 💡 **From Transcript (979s-989s):** "You may also need to provide an inventory of undamaged property if required. Again, you need to provide the number, the cash value, as well as the cost."

| Cost |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Undamaged items):**
> Sometimes you have to list the stuff that DIDN'T burn. This helps the insurer make sure you aren't lying about how much stuff was actually in the house.

---

### 8️⃣ Verified Accounting Records

> 💡 **From Transcript (989s-999s):** "You also have to produce verified accounting records, receipts, invoices, inventory lists, etc. And this is only needed if it's required and practicable."

| Documents to Produce |
|---------------------|
| Accounting records |
| Receipts |
| Invoices |
| Inventory lists |

| Only if required AND practicable |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Records):**
> Show your receipts! If you say you had a $2,000 computer, show the bill from Best Buy. If the receipts burned up, do your best to find a copy.

---

## 📊 Summary: 7 Proof of Loss Components

| # | Component | What to Provide |
|---|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Inventory of damaged property** | Number, value, amount claimed |
| 2 | **How loss occurred** | Best effort explanation, swear accidental |
| 3 | **Location at time of loss** | Where was property? |
| 4 | **Other insurance** | Policies share pro-rata |
| 5 | **Interests of others** | Mortgagee, co-owners |
| 6 | **Changes to property** | Use, ownership, location |
| 7 | **Undamaged property inventory** | If required |
| + | **Verified records** | Receipts, invoices if practicable |

---

## 👥 Who Can File Proof of Loss?

> 💡 **From Transcript (999s-1014s):** "And when it comes to giving notice or proof of loss, the insured of course can provide this notice, but so can any agent of the insured if it's justified. An agent meaning anybody that's authorized to do so. So a lawyer, a relative, a friend, or somebody else."

| **Friend** | If authorized |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Who can file):**
> Usually, it's YOU. But if you are in the hospital or out of the country, your lawyer, your mom, or your best friend can file for you if you say it's okay.

---

### 📋 Transcript Example: Mortgagee Filing (Arson Case!)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1014s-1041s):** "Of course those with insurable interest can also file the proof of loss if the insured refuses to do so. This is common in the cases where the insured may have committed some kind of insurance fraud and they're getting cold feet. Maybe they burned down their property and had a mortgage on it. They don't want to file the proof of loss because they're scared of getting caught. And so the bank, the mortgagee who has insurable interest, they can in turn file the proof of loss and get their money."

| Scenario | Who Files |
|----------|-----------|
| Insured commits arson | Insured WON'T file (scared) |
| Mortgagee has insurable interest | Bank FILES instead |
| Bank gets their money | Mortgagee protected |

```
Arson Scenario:
🔥 Owner burns down house (fraud!)
    ↓
😰 Owner scared to file proof of loss
    ↓
🏦 Bank (mortgagee) has mortgage on property
    ↓
📋 Bank files proof of loss instead
    ↓
💰 Bank gets their money (mortgage paid off)
```

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If someone burns down their own house and is too scared to file a claim, the BANK can file instead because they have a mortgage on it. The bank gets paid, even if the owner gets caught for fraud!

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (The Bank's Safety Net):**
> If a guy burns his house down on purpose (arson), he won't file a claim because he's afraid of jail. But the Bank still wants their mortgage money! Since the Bank is listed on the policy, they can file the claim themselves to get paid.
