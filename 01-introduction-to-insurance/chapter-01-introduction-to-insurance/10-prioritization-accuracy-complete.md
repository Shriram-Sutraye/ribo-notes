## 🎯 The Big Picture

> 🎯 **Plain English:** As a broker, you'll have a million things to do every day. Some are URGENT, some are important, some can wait. This section teaches you HOW to decide what to do first, and gives you tools to stay organized.

## 📋 How to Prioritize Tasks (4 Priority Levels)

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "As brokers you can sort of expect to handle a variety of tasks on any given day of varying urgency. There's no hard and fast rule around how you prioritize tasks but there's a couple things that you should base your decision making on."

### Priority Matrix:

```
🔴 HIGHEST PRIORITY: Legal/Regulatory Obligations
           ↓
🟠 HIGH PRIORITY: Time-Sensitive Tasks
           ↓
🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY: Client-Centered Tasks
           ↓
🟢 LOWER PRIORITY: Administrative Tasks
```

---

### 🔴 Priority 1: Legal & Regulatory Obligations (NON-NEGOTIABLE!)

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "The first are any regulatory or legal obligations. So certain tasks like remitting premiums, disclosing material facts or changes, or submitting proof of insurance are not negotiable because they're legal or regulatory requirements. Any failure to comply with these could lead to E&O or regulatory issues."

| Task | Why FIRST? |
|------|------------|
| **Remitting premiums** | Legal requirement - trust account rules |
| **Disclosing material facts** | RIBO Code of Conduct |
| **Submitting proof of insurance** | Client needs coverage NOW |
| **Regulatory filings** | Avoid RIBO discipline |

> ⚠️ **Consequences of Missing These:**
> - E&O claims against you
> - RIBO disciplinary action
> - License suspension/revocation
> - Legal liability

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If RIBO or the law says you MUST do something, that goes to the TOP of your list. No exceptions!

---

### 🟠 Priority 2: Time-Sensitive Client-Centered Tasks

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Or you could have a cross time sensitive client-centered tasks for example renewing their policies before expiry, responding to claims, placing coverage, etc. These time sensitive tasks should come first. For example if a client needs insurance on a home and it's closing tomorrow you should probably get on that immediately."

| Task | Why Urgent? |
|------|-------------|
| **Policy renewing tomorrow** | Client will be uninsured! |
| **Home closing tomorrow** | Bank requires insurance |
| **Responding to claims** | Client in distress |
| **Placing coverage immediately** | Coverage gap = liability |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If the client will be in trouble TONIGHT if you don't act, that's Priority 2. The house closing tomorrow? DROP EVERYTHING and get that coverage placed!

**Real Example from Transcript:**
> "If a client needs insurance on a home and it's closing tomorrow, you should probably get on that immediately."

---

### 🟡 Priority 3: Client-Centered Tasks (Not Immediately Urgent)

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "And then there's other client-centered tasks like renewals. Usually you want to start that two to three months out. Could be endorsements, could be new business. This may not be as high priority as those time sensitive tasks or those regulatory or legal obligations."

| Task | Timeline |
|------|----------|
| **Renewals** | 2-3 months out |
| **Endorsements** | Within a reasonable time |
| **New business quotes** | Important but not urgent |
| **Coverage reviews** | Scheduled check-ins |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** These are important but not "drop everything" urgent. The renewal is in 3 months? Great - put it on your calendar for next week. The endorsement request? Get to it today or tomorrow, not in a month.

---

### 🟢 Priority 4: Administrative Tasks

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "And finally there are also admin tasks such as updating the CRM, updating your brokerage management system, meetings with the team, following up on leads. Those things may not be as important."

| Task | When to Do |
|------|------------|
| **Updating CRM** | End of day or slow periods |
| **Updating BMS** | Between client tasks |
| **Team meetings** | Scheduled times |
| **Following up on leads** | When Priority 1-3 are handled |
| **Filing/organizing** | Slow periods |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Admin is IMPORTANT but not URGENT. If you have client emergencies, the CRM updates can wait until 4 PM. Don't let admin eat your whole day!

---

## 📊 Summary: Priority Order

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Typically the time-sensitive legal or high-risk tasks should come first before you move on to more routine or administrative tasks."

| Priority | Type | Examples | When |
|----------|------|----------|------|
| 🔴 1 | Legal/Regulatory | Remit premiums, disclosures | IMMEDIATELY |
| 🟠 2 | Time-Sensitive Client | Closing tomorrow, claims | SAME DAY |
| 🟡 3 | Client-Centered | Renewals, new business | Within days |
| 🟢 4 | Administrative | CRM updates, filing | When time permits |

## 📝 Part 2: Policy Changes

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Outside of processing new business or renewals, we also might be asked from time to time to assist customers with policy changes or remarketing."

### What is a Policy Change?

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "A policy change involves adding or removing coverage, adjusting limits, or changing the named insured. You can use things like endorsements, riders to make amendments to the policy."

| Policy Change Type | Examples |
|--------------------|----------|
| **Adding coverage** | Add flood coverage, add a driver |
| **Removing coverage** | Drop collision on old car |
| **Adjusting limits** | Increase liability from $1M to $2M |
| **Changing named insured** | Adding spouse, removing ex |

### How Changes Are Made:

| Method | What It Is |
|--------|------------|
| **Endorsement** | Amendment to the policy |
| **Rider** | Additional coverage attached |
| **OPCF (Auto)** | Ontario Policy Change Form |

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "When it comes to auto insurance, they're called OPCFs and we'll learn more about that in the auto insurance section."

> 🎯 **Plain English:** 
> - **Endorsement** = A change to the policy (adding coverage, changing limits)
> - **Rider** = Extra coverage "riding along" with the base policy
> - **OPCF** = Specifically for auto insurance in Ontario (e.g., OPCF 44 for rental cars)

---

## 🔄 Part 3: Remarketing

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Another key activity you might be doing as an insurance broker is called remarketing. Remarketing basically means shopping the policy with other insurers."

### What is Remarketing?

| Definition |
|------------|
| Shopping the client's policy with OTHER insurance companies to find better coverage or pricing |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Remarketing = taking the client's file and getting quotes from different insurers. It's like comparison shopping on their behalf.

---

### 3 Reasons for Remarketing:

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "This can happen for a few reasons."

#### Reason 1: Insurer Declines Renewal

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Maybe an insurance company declines a renewal because they have some change in the risk profile, there's a non-payment of premiums, or some issue like that."

| Why Insurer Declines | What Happened |
|---------------------|---------------|
| **Change in risk profile** | Client added a pool, started a business |
| **Non-payment of premiums** | Missed payments |
| **Claims history** | Too many claims |
| **Risk no longer fits appetite** | Insurer pulling out of market |

#### Reason 2: Client Requests It

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "It could also happen when a client requests it. Maybe they want you to find better coverage or lower premiums."

| Client Request | Why |
|----------------|-----|
| **Lower premiums** | "Can you find me something cheaper?" |
| **Better coverage** | "I want more liability coverage" |
| **Unhappy with insurer** | "Their claims service was terrible" |
| **Life changes** | Marriage, new house, need to shop |

#### Reason 3: Broker Suggests It

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Or it can also be done upon suggestion of the broker for the same reasons. You say, hey, you know what? We haven't shopped it around in a while. Let's shop it to see if we can find you some better pricing."

| Broker Suggests | Why |
|-----------------|-----|
| **Haven't shopped in a while** | "Let's see what else is out there" |
| **Market has changed** | New insurers, better rates available |
| **Client's risk profile improved** | Claims-free, better credit, etc. |
| **Cross-selling opportunity** | Bundle home and auto |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Remarketing is GOOD customer service! You're not just set-it-and-forget-it. You proactively look for better deals for your clients. This builds loyalty and prevents them from leaving for another broker.

## 📊 Summary: 3 Reasons for Remarketing

| Reason | Who Initiates |
|--------|---------------|
| **1. Insurer declines renewal** | Insurer |
| **2. Client requests it** | Client |
| **3. Broker suggests it** | You (the broker) |
