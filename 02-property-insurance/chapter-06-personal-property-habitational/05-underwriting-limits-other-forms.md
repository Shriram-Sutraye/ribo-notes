## 📋 Part 20: Underwriting Homeowners Forms (32:52-34:20)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1968.84s-1980.76s):** "Now let's talk about how homeowners forms are underwritten. So coverage is based on replacement cost value. The replacement values on dwelling buildings are set using an evaluation guide which gives you your basic limits."

### Underwriting Basics:

| Underwriting |
|--------------|
| Based on Replacement Cost Value |
| Evaluation guide sets basic limits |

---

### Coverage Limits:

> 💡 **From Transcript (1980.76s-2041.72s):** Details on limits for Coverages A through H.

| Coverage | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| **A** (Dwelling) | Replacement value of building |
| **B** (Detached) | 10% of Coverage A |
| **C** (Personal Property) | 70-90% of Coverage A |
| **D** (Additional Living) | 20% of Coverage A |
| **E** (Personal Liability) | Minimum $1,000,000 |
| **F** (Medical Payments) | $1,000/person, **no deductible** |
| **G** (Property Damage) | $500/occurrence, **no deductible** |
| **H** (Employee Compensation) | Per schedule |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Coverage A = $100,000

| If Coverage A = $100,000 |
|-------------------------|
| Coverage B = $10,000 (10%) |
| Coverage C = $70,000-$90,000 (70-90%) |
| Coverage D = $20,000 (20%) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Limits):**
> Your house is worth $500,000 (Coverage A). Everything else is calculated from that:
> - **B (Shed)**: $50,000 (10%)
> - **C (Stuff)**: $350,000-$450,000 (70-90%)
> - **D (Hotel if displaced)**: $100,000 (20%)
> - **E (If sued)**: At least $1,000,000

---

### Single Limit Policy Option

> 💡 **From Transcript (2048.04s-2060.52s):** "You also have the option to get something called a single limit policy. This combines your limits for Coverage A, B, C, and D into one big limit."

| Single Limit Policy |
|--------------------|
| Combines A + B + C + D into one limit |
| More flexibility in claims |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Instead of separate buckets for house, shed, stuff, and hotel, you get ONE BIG bucket. If your shed needs more money than 10%, you can use it from the combined pool.

---

## 🔧 Part 21: Endorsements (34:20-34:36)

> 💡 **From Transcript (2060.52s-2075.48s):** "Now let's talk about endorsements. You can always use endorsements to add additional coverage for watercraft, antique arts, coins, and stamp collections, jewellery and furs, personal computers, cameras, musical instruments, and many other things."

### Common Endorsements:

| What You Can Add |
|-----------------|
| Watercraft |
| Antique art |
| Coins & stamp collections |
| Jewellery & furs |
| Personal computers |
| Cameras |
| Musical instruments |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Remember those $2,000 limits on jewellery? If you have a $20,000 Rolex, buy an endorsement! Same for your coin collection, expensive camera, or guitar.

## 🏢 Part 22: Condo Owners Insurance (34:48-38:21)

> 💡 **From Transcript (2075.48s-2098.68s):** "So now that we're finished talking about homeowners insurance, we also need to talk about condos, tenants package, rented dwellings, mobile homes, and seasonal dwellings. These are the other types of habitational forms."

### What is a Condo?

> 💡 **From Transcript (2098.68s-2120.759s):** "So let's talk about condo owners insurance. First, a condo is basically a building where the units are owned separately by different owners but together they collectively form a strata corporation or a condo corporation. So the strata will own and insure the original value of the building as well as any common elements under a master policy."

| Condo Structure |
|-----------------|
| Units owned separately |
| Strata/condo corporation owns common elements |
| Master policy covers building + common elements |

### Common Elements:

| Common Elements |
|-----------------|
| Landscaping |
| Parking |
| Hallways |
| Amenities |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> In a condo, the STRATA owns the building and shared areas (lobby, pool, parking). Your UNIT is yours. The strata has their own insurance for the building. YOU need insurance for your unit and stuff inside.

---

### Types of Strata Buildings

> 💡 **From Transcript (2122.359s-2152.76s):** "Strata or condo buildings can come in various forms. It can be your classic condo building, but it can also be things like detached houses in the event of a barren land condo, planned communities, retirement villages, gated communities, or even your classic high rise."

| Strata Types |
|--------------|
| Classic condo building |
| Barren land condo (detached houses) |
| Planned communities |
| Retirement villages |
| Gated communities |
| High-rise |

---

### Condo Unit Owner's Policy

> 💡 **From Transcript (2153.48s-2172.2s):** "As a unit owner, you can also purchase your own insurance and that's called the condo unit owners policy. It covers personal property as well as additional living expenses just like homeowners but it also has some coverages that are specific to condo owners."

| Condo Unit Owner's Policy |
|--------------------------|
| Personal property |
| Additional living expenses |
| + Condo-specific coverages (A1, A2, A3) |

---

### Coverage A1: The Unit ($100,000)

> 💡 **From Transcript (2172.2s-2193.799s):** "The first is Coverage A1 which is the unit. It will give you up to $100,000 to cover the original unit building, fixtures, glass, permanently attached outdoor equipment anywhere on the property. If the strata has no insurance or if the insurance for the strata is inadequate or ineffective. This is not to be used for paying the strata's deductible."

| Coverage A1: Unit |
|------------------|
| Limit: Up to $100,000 |
| Covers: Original unit, fixtures, glass, outdoor equipment |
| Used if strata has no/inadequate insurance |
| **NOT for strata's deductible** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> The strata's insurance should cover the building. But what if they didn't buy enough coverage? A1 gives you up to $100K as backup. But it does NOT pay the strata's deductible—that's their problem!

---

### Coverage A2: Loss Assessment ($10,000)

> 💡 **From Transcript (2193.799s-2253.32s):** "Coverage A2 for condos is your loss assessment coverage. So this is applicable when the strata's policy is inadequate to cover losses to collective property. In those cases, the strata may need to assess the owners to cover the shortfall, meaning to request money from the owners. The limit here is usually $10,000 or a certain percentage of your personal property coverage usually 100 to 250%."

| Coverage A2: Loss Assessment |
|-----------------------------|
| Limit: $10,000 (or 100-250% of personal property) |
| Covers shortfall from strata's inadequate policy |
| Strata "assesses" owners for money |

**When Strata Policy is "Inadequate":**
- Deductible too big
- Loss not covered
- Co-insurance violation
- Limits too small

**Limitation:**

> 💡 **From Transcript (2231.88s-2247.32s):** "The limitation of Coverage A2 is it only covers if the cause of loss would have been covered under your condo policy. So if on your condo policy you didn't purchase earthquake insurance and the earthquake loss was what triggered the loss assessment, your Coverage A2 would not kick in."

| A2 Limitation |
|---------------|
| Must be a peril covered by YOUR condo policy |
| No earthquake endorsement? No A2 for earthquake assessment |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> The strata says: "The roof leaked and we need $50,000. Each unit owner pays $5,000." Your A2 coverage pays that $5,000 for you. BUT if the leak was from an earthquake and YOU didn't buy earthquake coverage, A2 won't help.

---

### Coverage A3: Unit Improvements & Betterments

> 💡 **From Transcript (2260.36s-2317.959s):** "And lastly we have Coverage A3 which is unit improvements and betterments. This pays 100% of your Coverage A1 limit for upgrades that are not covered by the strata's insurance because remember the strata's insurance policy covers the original building value. If you've made any upgrades, maybe you've put in a sound system, you've upgraded the flooring, anything like that, you would need to pay for those yourself through your own insurance policy."

| Coverage A3: Improvements |
|--------------------------|
| Limit: 100% of A1 |
| Covers upgrades not covered by strata |
| Flooring, cabinets, sound systems, etc. |
| Materials for improvements |

### 📋 Transcript Example: New Carpet

> 💡 **From Transcript (2307.959s-2317.959s):** "So if you intend to put in some new carpet, it's halfway installed, you have a roll of carpet sitting in the corner of the room, that would be covered as well as part of Coverage A3."

| Covered Under A3 |
|-----------------|
| Upgraded flooring |
| New cabinets |
| Sound system |
| Swimming pool (if added) |
| Shed (in stratified community) |
| Materials for improvements (roll of carpet) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You ripped out the cheap carpet and installed hardwood floors. The strata's policy covers the original CHEAP carpet, not your fancy hardwood. A3 covers your upgrade.

---

### Condo Claim Settlement

> 💡 **From Transcript (2317.959s-2341.88s):** "The basis of settlement when it comes to any of these condo insurance policies is the same as homeowners. You can choose replacement costs or actual cash value. So typically if you had a loss, it would pay for your unit betterments if there are any, plus any property that was damaged minus your deductible."

| Condo Claim Formula |
|--------------------|
| Unit betterments + Property damage - Deductible |
| RC or ACV (your choice) |

---

## 🏠 Part 23: Tenants Package (38:21-38:45)

> 💡 **From Transcript (2342.12s-2359.8s):** "Next we'll talk about the tenants package. This covers personal property and additional living expenses. Note that there is no building coverage here because you are a tenant. You have no insurable interest in the building itself. This insurance is purchased by renters, meaning people who don't own the residence they occupy."

### Tenants Package:

| Tenants Package |
|-----------------|
| Personal property ✅ |
| Additional living expenses ✅ |
| Building coverage ❌ (you don't own it) |
| For renters |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You rent an apartment. You don't own the building, so you don't insure it. But your STUFF (TV, clothes, furniture) and your LIVING EXPENSES (if you have to move out) are covered.

---

## 🏘️ Part 24: Rented Dwelling Insurance (38:45-39:21)

> 💡 **From Transcript (2359.88s-2377.72s):** "Next is rented dwelling insurance. This is for owners of rental properties and is usually insured on an actual cash value basis only. This insurance is usually not offered unless the insurance company also insures the client's principal residence. Losses caused by vandalism and theft are excluded as well."

### Rented Dwelling Insurance:

| Rented Dwelling |
|-----------------|
| For LANDLORDS (owners of rental property) |
| Usually ACV only (not replacement cost) |
| Insurer often requires principal residence policy |
| **Excludes: Vandalism, Theft** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You own a house and rent it out. You need landlord insurance. But insurance companies are cautious—they usually only sell it if you ALSO insure your own home with them. And they don't cover vandalism or theft (risky with tenants!).

---

## 🚐 Part 25: Mobile Home Insurance (39:21-40:12)

> 💡 **From Transcript (2381.24s-2419.88s):** "Next on the list is mobile home insurance. With this, the definition of the dwelling is now expanded to include any permanent furniture, fixtures, and equipment. They also have coverage for emergency removal expenses. They will spend 5% of your dwelling limit to pay for disconnecting power, water, and transportation costs when your mobile home is necessarily removed."

### Mobile Home Insurance:

| Mobile Home |
|-------------|
| Dwelling = includes permanent furniture, fixtures, equipment |
| Emergency removal: 5% of dwelling limit |
| Disconnecting power, water |
| Transportation costs |

**Limitation:**

> 💡 **From Transcript (2412.84s-2419.88s):** "However you have no coverage while your mobile home is in transit."

| Mobile Home Limitation |
|-----------------------|
| No coverage in transit |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Mobile home insurance covers the home PLUS the built-in furniture. If there's a flood warning, insurance pays to disconnect and move your home (5% of limit). BUT once it's rolling down the highway, you have NO coverage until it stops.

---

## 🏕️ Part 26: Seasonal Dwellings (40:12-40:26)

> 💡 **From Transcript (2419.88s-2426.12s):** "As for seasonal dwellings, this coverage can usually be added to the primary policy simply as an additional location."

### Seasonal Dwelling:

| Seasonal Dwelling |
|------------------|
| Can be added to primary policy |
| Listed as additional location |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You have a cottage you use in summer. Just add it to your main home insurance as a second location. Easy!
