## What Is Liability Exposure?

**Liability exposure** = The risk that you'll be held legally responsible for someone else's injury, death, or property damage, and be required to pay for it.

> 💡 **Key Concept:** Liability is about **harming others** — not yourself.

---

## Types of Liability Exposures

| Type | What It Covers | Example |
|------|----------------|---------|
| **Workers' Compensation** | Injuries to employees on the job | Worker falls off ladder at work |
| **Premises/Operations** | Injuries on your property or from operations | Customer slips in store |
| **Product Liability** | Injuries caused by products you make/sell | Defective toy injures child |
| **Professional Liability** | Errors in professional services | Lawyer misses filing deadline |
| **Auto Liability** | Injuries from vehicle ownership/use | Delivery driver causes accident |

---

## 1️⃣ Workers' Compensation

**Definition:** Coverage for employees who are injured or become ill due to their job.

### What It Covers:
| Coverage | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Medical expenses | Hospital, doctors, medication |
| Lost wages | Income while unable to work |
| Rehabilitation | Physical therapy, retraining |
| Death benefits | Payments to family if worker dies |

### Ontario Context:
In Ontario, workers' comp is provided by the **Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB)**, NOT private insurance!

> ⚠️ **RIBO Exam Note:** WSIB is mandatory for most Ontario employers. It operates on a "no-fault" basis — workers get benefits regardless of who was at fault.

### Example:
> **Factory Worker Injury**
> 
> A machine operator catches their hand in equipment:
> - WSIB covers all medical costs
> - WSIB pays 85% of net earnings while off work
> - Worker cannot sue the employer

## 2️⃣ Premises/Operations Liability

**Definition:** Liability arising from your property or business activities.

### Two Components:

| Premises Liability | Operations Liability |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Injuries ON your property | Injuries FROM your activities |
| Customer slips in store | Painter spills on neighbor's car |
| Visitor falls down stairs | Construction damages nearby property |

### Common Causes:
| Cause | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Slip and fall | Wet floor without warning sign |
| Falling objects | Product falls from shelf onto customer |
| Inadequate security | Assault in poorly-lit parking lot |
| Property defects | Broken handrail causes fall |

### Real-Life Scenario:
> **Grocery Store Slip & Fall**
> 
> Customer #1 spills cooking oil in Aisle 3. Customer #2 walks through, slips, and breaks their hip 20 minutes later.
> 
> **Is the store liable?** Potentially yes — if they didn't clean it up in a "reasonable" time or didn't put up a warning sign.

## 3️⃣ Product Liability

**Definition:** Legal responsibility for injuries caused by products you manufacture, distribute, or sell.

### Three Bases for Claims:

| Basis | What It Means | Example |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| **Manufacturing Defect** | Something went wrong in production | Metal shavings in food |
| **Design Defect** | The product design itself is unsafe | Car prone to rollovers |
| **Failure to Warn** | Missing safety instructions/warnings | No warning that toy is choking hazard |

### Real-Life Scenario:
> **Defective Coffee Maker**
> 
> A coffee maker overheats and catches fire, burning down a customer's kitchen.
> 
> - **Manufacturer** is liable (defective product)
> - **Retailer** might also be liable (sold the product)
> - Customer can sue both!

---

## 4️⃣ Other Liability Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Contractual Liability** | Liability assumed through contracts | Lease requires tenant to insure landlord |
| **Employers' Liability** | Lawsuits from employees (beyond WSIB) | Sexual harassment claims |
| **Directors & Officers (D&O)** | Liability of company leadership | Shareholders sue for bad decisions |
| **Professional (E&O)** | Errors in professional advice | Accountant makes tax error |

## What Are Perils?

**Perils** are the **causes** of loss. They're what actually triggers the damage.

---

## The 3 Categories of Perils

| Category | Definition | Examples |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **Natural** | Caused by nature | 🌪️ Windstorm, 🌊 Flood, ⚡ Lightning, 🌋 Earthquake |
| **Human** | Caused by people (intentional or accidental) | 🔥 Arson, 🏚️ Vandalism, 🔓 Theft, 💥 Riots |
| **Economic** | Related to financial/business conditions | 📉 Recession, 💸 Currency fluctuation, 🏭 Supply chain disruption |

---

## Natural Perils (Examples)

| Peril | What Happens | Coverage Notes |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| **Fire** | Flames destroy property | Covered in most policies |
| **Windstorm** | Wind damages roof, trees fall | Usually covered |
| **Flood** | Water from outside enters property | Often **EXCLUDED** — needs separate policy |
| **Earthquake** | Ground shaking damages buildings | Often **EXCLUDED** — needs endorsement |
| **Hail** | Ice damages cars, roofs | Usually covered |

> ⚠️ **RIBO Exam Alert:** Flood and earthquake are typically NOT covered under standard property policies in Canada!

---

## Human Perils (Examples)

| Peril | Type | Coverage |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Theft** | Crime | Covered (with limitations) |
| **Vandalism** | Intentional damage | Usually covered |
| **Arson** | Intentional fire | Covered (unless by insured!) |
| **Riots/Civil Commotion** | Group violence | May be excluded during declared emergencies |
| **Accidental Fire** | Careless action | Covered |

---

## Economic Perils (Examples)

| Peril | Impact | Insurable? |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **Recession** | Demand drops | Generally not insurable |
| **Supplier Failure** | Can't get materials | Contingent business interruption |
| **Currency Changes** | Import costs rise | Financial hedging, not insurance |
| **Cyber Attack** | Business disruption | Cyber insurance covers this |

---

## 📝 Summary: Liability vs. Perils

| Concept | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Liability Exposure** | Risk of being held responsible | Being sued for customer injury |
| **Peril** | The cause of a loss | Fire, theft, flood |

> **Think of it this way:**
> - **Liability** = WHO is responsible
> - **Peril** = WHAT caused it

## 🧠 Practice Question

> A restaurant is reviewing their insurance. Which of the following represents a "human" peril?
> 
> a) Lightning strikes the building  
> b) An earthquake damages the foundation  
> c) A disgruntled former employee sets fire to the kitchen  
> d) A flood enters through the basement

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer: c) A disgruntled former employee sets fire to the kitchen**

- a) Lightning = **Natural** peril
- b) Earthquake = **Natural** peril  
- c) Arson by former employee = **Human** peril ✅
