---

## 📋 Part 15: Homeowners Basic Form - 13 Named Perils (20:55-25:55)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1256.84s-1283.8s):** "So now that we've laid the foundation, let's talk about actual homeowners policies. So you're going to see three general types: the basic, the broad, and the comprehensive. Let's talk about the homeowners basic form first. So the homeowners basic form is a type of named perils policy. That means it covers the perils that are specifically named on the policy. A typical named perils policy will come with 13 coverages."

### Homeowners Basic Form:

| Basic Form |
|------------|
| Named Perils policy |
| 13 specific perils covered |
| If not listed, NOT covered |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Basic Form = The "Short Menu." Only 13 things are covered. If something happens that's NOT on the list (like earthquake), you get nothing.

---

### The 13 Named Perils:

---

#### 1. Fire or Lightning

> 💡 **From Transcript (1284.44s-1294.04s):** "So the first one is fire or lightning. So very similar to the fire policy coverage we learned about earlier but now it extends coverage to lightning damage to electrical devices."

| Peril #1: Fire/Lightning |
|-------------------------|
| Fire damage |
| Lightning damage (including electrical devices) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> House catches fire? Covered. Lightning fries your TV? Also covered.

---

#### 2. Explosion

> 💡 **From Transcript (1295.24s-1311.8s):** "The second coverage is explosion. So again very similar to the fire policy coverage except now also covers domestic boilers. However it excludes explosions caused by water hammer. So water hammer means that explosion caused by the build-up of pressure inside blocked pipes."

| Peril #2: Explosion |
|--------------------|
| Explosions covered |
| Domestic boilers covered |
| **Excluded: Water hammer** (pressure buildup in pipes) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your furnace explodes? Covered. Your hot water tank explodes? Covered. But if your pipes bang and burst because of pressure buildup, that's "water hammer" and it's NOT covered.

---

#### 3. Smoke

> 💡 **From Transcript (1313.0s-1324.92s):** "The third coverage is smoke. It covers smoke from a malfunctioning furnace or cooking appliance. So it's a very specific type of smoke."

| Peril #3: Smoke |
|-----------------|
| Smoke from malfunctioning furnace |
| Smoke from malfunctioning cooking appliance |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your furnace malfunctions and fills the house with smoke? Covered. Your oven goes crazy and smokes up the kitchen? Covered. But smoke from a fireplace you left open? That might NOT be covered—check the policy.

---

#### 4. Windstorm and Hail

> 💡 **From Transcript (1324.92s-1354.2s):** "Next is wind storm and hail. So this generally covers damage to the exterior but the interior is covered as well if a hole is created by the same occurrence. So for example if there's a wind storm and you left the window open, the wind got in and damaged interior, you would have no coverage. However if the wind broke the window and then came into damage the interior, you would have coverage."

| Peril #4: Windstorm/Hail |
|-------------------------|
| Exterior damage covered |
| Interior covered IF hole created by same peril |
| **Not covered: Left window open** |
| Covered: Wind broke window, then damaged interior |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Open Window vs Broken Window

| Scenario | Covered? |
|----------|----------|
| Left window open, wind damages interior | ❌ No |
| Wind breaks window, then damages interior | ✅ Yes |

**Excludes:**
- Antennas
- Damage from accumulated snow, flood, or waves

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Wind damages your roof? Covered. Hail cracks your siding? Covered. BUT if you left the window open and rain blew in, that's YOUR fault—not covered. If the wind BROKE the window and then rain came in, NOW it's covered.

---

#### 5. Impact by Vehicle

> 💡 **From Transcript (1355.56s-1368.12s):** "Next is impact by vehicle. So if a car crashes into your house you have coverage. But it excludes damage caused to pets or any damage caused by a vehicle operated by the insured or their employee."

| Peril #5: Vehicle Impact |
|-------------------------|
| Car crashes into house = Covered |
| **Excluded: Pets hit by vehicle** |
| **Excluded: Damage by insured's own vehicle** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> A random car crashes into your living room? Covered. YOU back your own car into your garage door? NOT covered (that's your fault). Your dog is hit by a car? NOT covered.

---

#### 6. Falling Object

> 💡 **From Transcript (1368.84s-1379.479s):** "Next is falling object. So this covers damage to structures. Very similar to the wind storm and hail coverage, it only covers coincidental damage to personal property or the interior."

| Peril #6: Falling Object |
|-------------------------|
| Damage to structure covered |
| Interior/personal property covered if coincidental |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> A tree branch falls and punches a hole in your roof? Covered. The stuff inside that got wet because of the hole? Also covered (coincidental damage).

---

#### 7. Theft and Damage During Theft

> 💡 **From Transcript (1380.84s-1398.36s):** "Next is theft and damage during theft. So you have pretty broad coverage for theft but it excludes pets, scams so if you're tricked it doesn't count, buildings under construction, buildings that are vacant, or theft or damage during theft to portions of the building not occupied by the insured."

| Peril #7: Theft |
|-----------------|
| Theft of property covered |
| Damage during theft covered |

**Excludes:**
- Pets
- Scams/tricks
- Buildings under construction
- Vacant buildings
- Theft from parts NOT occupied by insured

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Someone breaks in and steals your TV? Covered. They also kicked in the door? That damage is covered too. But if you were SCAMMED (like a fake online sale), that's NOT theft—not covered. And if your house has been empty for months, no theft coverage.

---

#### 8. Riot

> 💡 **From Transcript (1399.56s-1406.76s):** "The next coverage is riot."

| Peril #8: Riot |
|----------------|
| Damage from riots covered |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> A riot breaks out and your windows get smashed. Covered.

---

#### 9. Vandalism or Malicious Acts

> 💡 **From Transcript (1406.76s-1420.199s):** "And after that you have coverage for vandalism or malicious acts. So even though you have broad coverage it excludes damage caused by the insured or during a theft, construction, or vacant building. So vandalism during theft is excluded here because it's covered above by number seven."

| Peril #9: Vandalism |
|--------------------|
| Malicious damage covered |

**Excludes:**
- Damage by insured
- Damage during theft (covered under #7)
- Buildings under construction
- Vacant buildings

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Someone spray-paints graffiti on your house? Covered. But if YOU damage your own property, that's not vandalism—that's intentional destruction.

---

#### 10. Water Damage

> 💡 **From Transcript (1420.199s-1488.679s):** "Next is water damage. So it covers water damage caused by the sudden and accidental escape of water, for example from a pipe, domestic water container, or an AC unit. It also covers water entering the building through an opening created by an insured peril."

| Peril #10: Water Damage |
|------------------------|
| Sudden/accidental water escape |
| From pipes, water containers, AC |
| Water entering through insured-peril hole |

**Excludes:**
- Vacant buildings
- Sewer backup
- Continuous seepage (slow leak)
- Flood or overflow
- Damage to the system itself (plumbing)
- Freeze damage if away >4 days in winter (unless drained or checked daily)

### 📋 Transcript Example: Basement Water

| Scenario | Covered? |
|----------|----------|
| Left basement window open, water got in | ❌ No |
| Car crashed into basement, created hole, water got in | ✅ Yes |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Pipe bursts suddenly? Covered. Pipe has been slowly leaking for months? NOT covered. Sewer backs up? NOT covered (need an endorsement). Left for vacation in winter without draining pipes or having someone check? NOT covered if they freeze.

---

#### 11. Glass Breakage

> 💡 **From Transcript (1488.679s-1516.919s):** "The 11th coverage is for glass breakage. So it covers the breakage of building glass due to any kind of accident or earth movement. So it's important to note that building glass is not the same as a glass object. So a glass vase will not have coverage but a glass window would."

| Peril #11: Glass Breakage |
|--------------------------|
| Building glass (windows, doors) covered |
| **NOT: Glass objects** (vases, ornaments) |

**Excludes:**
- Buildings under construction
- Vacant buildings

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your WINDOW breaks? Covered. Your glass VASE falls and breaks? NOT covered here (that's personal property under Coverage C).

---

#### 12. Transportation

> 💡 **From Transcript (1516.919s-1527.32s):** "The 12th coverage is transportation. So it covers your personal property and your fixtures while they're being transported or are temporarily off premises."

| Peril #12: Transportation |
|--------------------------|
| Personal property in transit |
| Fixtures temporarily off premises |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You're moving your couch to a new house. It's in the moving truck. Covered.

---

#### 13. Electricity (Power Surge)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1527.32s-1535.72s):** "And finally you have coverage for electricity. So it covers any damage caused by power surges or power fluctuations like a brownout."

| Peril #13: Electricity |
|-----------------------|
| Power surges |
| Brownouts |
| Power fluctuations |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Lightning causes a power surge and fries your electronics? Covered in the Basic form!

---

## ❌ Part 16: Basic Form Exclusions (25:35-26:25)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1535.72s-1596.28s):** "There are some important exclusions you need to know."

### Basic Form Exclusions:

| Exclusion | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| **Business use buildings** | Unless insurer permits |
| **Farming** | Counts as business |
| **Illegal property** | Stolen, smuggled, unregistered |

| **Intentional acts** | You damage your own property |
| **Property on display** | Artwork at gallery |
| **Application of heat** | Clothes damaged in dryer (but resultant damage covered) |

> Your clothes shrunk in the dryer? NOT covered (but if the dryer starts a fire, that IS covered).

---

## 📋 Part 17: Homeowners Broad Form (26:25-27:03)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1605.8s-1622.439s):** "You have the homeowner broad form and the homeowner comprehensive form. The homeowner broad form covers your property for named perils just like the basic form but your building is covered for all risk just like the comprehensive form."

### Broad Form:

| Component | Coverage Type |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Building** | All-Risk (like Comprehensive) |
| **Personal Property** | Named Perils (like Basic) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Broad = Hybrid. Your HOUSE gets the good coverage (all-risk), but your STUFF still only gets the 13 perils.

---

## 📋 Part 18: Homeowners Comprehensive Form (27:03-32:12)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1622.439s-1636.6s):** "So what is the comprehensive form? The comprehensive form is just like broad form except now even your property is covered for all risks. So when we say all risks, what we mean is that it covers everything except the stuff that is specifically excluded by the policy."

### Comprehensive Form:

| Component | Coverage Type |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Building** | All-Risk |
| **Personal Property** | All-Risk |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Comprehensive = The BEST. Everything is covered UNLESS the policy says "except this." It's the opposite of Named Perils—instead of listing what's covered, it lists what's NOT covered.

---

### Comprehensive Form Exclusions:

> 💡 **From Transcript (1636.6s-1913.88s):** Multiple exclusions listed.

| Category | Exclusions |
|----------|------------|
| **Water** | Same as Basic (sewer, flood, seepage) |
| **Earth Movement** | Snow slide, earthquake (but resulting fire covered) |
| **Wear & Tear** | Normal aging, mechanical breakdown |
| **Building Shifts** | Settling, expansion, bulging, contracting |
| **Sports Equipment** | Damaged during use |

| **Birds/Vermin** | Damage by animals |

| **Industrial Smoke** | From factories |
| **Outdoor Antenna** | Wind, hail, collapse, ice/snow weight |

| **Pets** | Unless specified peril (not vehicle) |
| **Lawfully Seized Property** | Unless destroyed to prevent fire |
| **Fragile Property** | Chipping/scratching (unless specified peril or theft) |

| **Theft During Construction** | Materials on site |
| **Fraud/Scams** | Being tricked out of property |

| **Fuel Oil Release** | Pollution |
| **Ownership Change by Fraud** | Scammed out of property |
| **Rust/Corrosion/Rot** | |
| **Glass/Vandalism to Vacant/Construction** | Even if permitted |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Snow Slide → Fire

> 💡 **From Transcript (1649.879s-1669.0s):** "The most important thing here being earthquake is not covered, however resulting fire or explosion is covered. So for example if a snow slide leads to a fire, the snow slide damage would not be covered but the damage to your building caused by the fire would be."

| Scenario | Covered? |
|----------|----------|
| Snow slide damage | ❌ No |
| Fire CAUSED by snow slide | ✅ Yes |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Earthquake knocks down your house? NOT covered. Earthquake knocks over a candle and starts a fire? The FIRE damage is covered!

---

### 📋 Transcript Example: Data Sensor Malfunction

> 💡 **From Transcript (1823.96s-1859.639s):** "What do we actually mean by losses caused by data problem? So for example let's say you have a sensor that shuts off the water when it reaches a certain level or it shuts off the boiler when it reaches a certain temperature. If that sensor passes the wrong temperature data to the control unit and the control unit doesn't shut off the water, doesn't shut off the heat at the right amount of time, there can be water damage or fire that results. So damage caused directly by that data problem is not covered but resultant fire, explosion, smoke, and water is."

| Scenario | Covered? |
|----------|----------|
| Sensor malfunction (data error) | ❌ No |
| Fire caused by sensor malfunction | ✅ Yes |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your smart thermostat glitches and doesn't turn off the heat. Not covered. But if that causes a fire? The fire damage IS covered.

---

## ✅ Part 19: Advantages of Comprehensive/All-Risk (32:12-32:52)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1932.52s-1968.84s):** "So the advantage of course is that it insures all losses that are not specifically excluded, which means you get broader coverage. For example it insures things like roof collapse due to snow load, smoke damage from a fireplace, damage to a dwelling from impact by vehicle driven by the insured or his agent or employee, and finally if your jewellery falls down a drain, a gem pops out of your ring, something like that, you would still have coverage for those because of course they are not excluded."

### Comprehensive Covers Things Basic Doesn't:

| Coverage | Basic | Comprehensive |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| Roof collapse from snow | ❌ | ✅ |
| Smoke from fireplace | ❌ | ✅ |
| Damage by insured's own vehicle | ❌ | ✅ |
| Jewellery down the drain | ❌ | ✅ |
| Gem falls out of ring | ❌ | ✅ |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Comprehensive is worth the extra money because it covers "weird" things that Basic doesn't:
> - You back your car into your own garage.
> - Your ring falls apart and the diamond goes down the drain.
> - Heavy snow collapses your roof.
> - Smoke from your own fireplace stains the walls.
