> **Timestamp:** 4:00 - 7:00 (240s - 420s) | **Chapter 08 - Part 3**

---

## 🎯 Two Types of Torts (4:00 - 4:15)

> 💡 **From Transcript (240.799s-249.04s):** "Even within torts you have two types, you have intentional torts and unintentional torts."

| Two Types of Torts |
|-------------------|
| **1. Intentional Torts** |
| **2. Unintentional Torts** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Did you MEAN to do it?
> - **Intentional:** "I knew what I was doing" (NOT insurable!)
> - **Unintentional:** "It was an accident" (insurable!)

---

## ❌ Unintentional Torts (4:15 - 4:28)

> 💡 **From Transcript (249.04s-255.359s):** "So an unintentional torts is something that is caused by carelessness you did not intend to do it."

> 💡 **From Transcript (255.359s-261.12s):** "With unintentional torts, the wronged party is of course entitled to sue at-fault party, even though it wasn't intentional."

| Unintentional Torts |
|--------------------|
| Caused by **CARELESSNESS** |
| You did NOT intend to do it |
| Wronged party CAN still sue |
| **IS insurable!** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You didn't MEAN to hurt anyone—you were just careless. Maybe you forgot to put out a wet floor sign and someone slipped. You didn't WANT them to fall, but they did because you were careless. They can still sue you, but the good news: **your insurance can cover this!**

---

## ⚠️ Intentional Torts (4:28 - 5:00)

> 💡 **From Transcript (261.12s-268.32s):** "The second are intentional torts. Of course, people can still sue for intentional torts, but intentional torts are not insurable."

| Intentional Torts |
|------------------|
| People CAN still sue |
| But they are **NOT insurable!** |

> [!WARNING]
> **KEY POINT:** Intentional torts are NOT covered by insurance! If you deliberately hurt someone, you're paying out of your own pocket.

---

### What Counts as "Intentional"?

> 💡 **From Transcript (268.4s-274.24s):** "An intentional torts can occur if you took an action that a reasonable person would expect harm from."

| What's "Intentional"? |
|----------------------|
| Action a reasonable person would expect harm from |
| Doesn't matter if you didn't WANT harm |
| If harm was FORESEEABLE, it's intentional |

---

### 📋 Transcript Example: Pushing Friend into Pool

> 💡 **From Transcript (274.24s-280.0s):** "For example, if you are joking around with your friends and you accidentally push them into the pool and they hurt themselves."

> 💡 **From Transcript (280.0s-283.92s):** "that is an intentional torts even if you didn't intend to hurt them."

> 💡 **From Transcript (283.92s-289.28s):** "because a reasonable person would expect harm to occur if you pushed somebody into a pool."

| Pool Pushing Example |
|---------------------|
| **Scenario:** Joking around, push friend into pool |
| **Result:** Friend gets hurt |
| **Your claim:** "I didn't mean to hurt them!" |
| **Verdict:** **INTENTIONAL TORT!** |
| **Why:** Reasonable person EXPECTS harm if you push someone |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> "But I was just joking!" doesn't work as a defense. If you push someone into a pool, any reasonable person would expect they could get hurt—hit their head, couldn't swim, etc. Even if you didn't WANT them hurt, you KNEW harm was possible. That makes it intentional. **Your insurance won't cover this!**

---

## 🔥 Strict Liability (5:00 - 5:20)

> 💡 **From Transcript (289.28s-295.2s):** "There's also a concept that applies to your called strict liability. That is where a person is held automatically responsible if they are doing some kind of dangerous activity."

> 💡 **From Transcript (295.2s-300.24s):** "such as allowing the spread of an intentionally started fire or even if you're doing a reasonable act but in an unreasonable setting."

| Strict Liability |
|-----------------|
| **Automatically responsible** |
| For dangerous activities |
| No need to prove negligence |
| Applies to: |
| - Intentionally started fires |
| - Reasonable act in unreasonable setting |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Some activities are SO DANGEROUS that you're liable no matter what. Setting off fireworks? You're responsible if something goes wrong—even if you were super careful! The law says "you chose to do something dangerous, so you accept ALL the risk."

---

## 👤 Tortfeasors (5:12 - 5:24)

> 💡 **From Transcript (312.034s-313.04s):** "Tortfeasors is a key term here."

> 💡 **From Transcript (313.04s-318.16s):** "That means somebody who commits a wrong against an innocent party so the defendant in this case."

> 💡 **From Transcript (318.16s-323.92s):** "There can also be joint tortfeasors, where there's two or more people acting together to cause a tort."

| Tortfeasor Definition |
|----------------------|
| Person who commits the wrong |
| = The DEFENDANT |
| **Joint Tortfeasors** = 2+ people acting together |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> "Tortfeasor" = the person who did the wrong thing. If you sue someone, THEY are the tortfeasor.
> 
> "Joint tortfeasors" = two or more people who teamed up to do something wrong. Like if two people prank someone together and cause injury.

---

## 📋 Onus of Proof (5:30 - 6:05)

> 💡 **From Transcript (323.92s-330.8s):** "So in the case of tort, the onus of proof typically falls upon the plaintiff, meaning the person that is suing."

| Onus of Proof |
|--------------|
| Normally on the **PLAINTIFF** |
| = Person doing the suing |
| Plaintiff must prove the 3 elements |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> If you sue someone, YOU have to prove they did something wrong. The defendant doesn't have to prove they're innocent—you have to prove they're guilty. This is called the "burden of proof."

---

### When Onus Shifts to Defendant

> 💡 **From Transcript (330.8s-336.16s):** "But the onus can shift to the defendant if the following scenario is applied."

> 💡 **From Transcript (336.16s-341.6s):** "So in examples of statutory liability. In those cases, certain laws may presume that the defendant is liable, requiring them to show due diligence instead."

| When Onus Shifts to Defendant |
|------------------------------|
| **1. Statutory Liability** - law presumes defendant liable |
| **2. Strict Liability** - automatically liable |
| Defendant must prove due diligence |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Sometimes the law says "we're going to assume you're guilty." Then YOU have to prove you're innocent! This happens with:
> - Statutory liability (specific laws that flip the burden)
> - Strict liability (dangerous activities)

---

### Rylands v. Fletcher Case

> 💡 **From Transcript (342.32s-348.24s):** "or in the scenario of strict liability. The relevant case law here is Rylands v. Fletcher."

> 💡 **From Transcript (348.24s-353.76s):** "Under a strict liability scenario, the defendant is considered liable, even if there is no negligence or wrongful intent."

| Rylands v. Fletcher |
|--------------------|
| Famous strict liability case |
| Defendant liable EVEN IF: |
| - No negligence, AND |
| - No wrongful intent |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> The Rylands v. Fletcher case is a famous British case that created the "strict liability" rule. In that case, a reservoir flooded a neighbor's mine. The court said: "Even though you didn't MEAN to flood them and you weren't careless, you're STILL liable because you created a dangerous situation."

---

### 📋 Transcript Examples: Strict Liability Activities

> 💡 **From Transcript (353.76s-360.16s):** "And strict liability would typically apply when someone is doing something that's inherently dangerous."

> 💡 **From Transcript (360.16s-370.88s):** "So for example, if you're sending off fireworks or you're intentionally setting a fire for some reason, maybe agricultural smudging or forestry sort of purposes, you are considered liable automatically even if you're not negligent or have any wrongful intent."

| Strict Liability Activities |
|----------------------------|
| Setting off **fireworks** |
| **Intentionally starting fires** (agricultural smudging, forestry) |
| Any inherently dangerous activity |

> 💡 **From Transcript (370.88s-382.0s):** "So if you cause harm in doing that activity for example, letting off fireworks, you're liable even if you are not negligent."

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Some activities are so dangerous that "I was careful!" doesn't work as a defense:
> - Fireworks (even if you follow every safety rule)
> - Controlled burns (even if you hired professionals)
> 
> If you chose to do something dangerous, you accept 100% responsibility for any harm.

---

## 🔴 Absolute Liability (6:30 - 6:45)

> 💡 **From Transcript (382.0s-392.0s):** "One level above that is absolute liability. This means that you're liable even if you acted with all the required due diligence."

> 💡 **From Transcript (392.0s-397.12s):** "This is usually something where there's liability ascribed to you via statute."

| Absolute Liability |
|-------------------|
| **Even stricter** than strict liability |
| Liable even if you used all due diligence |
| Usually created by **statute** (written law) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> This is the HARSHEST form of liability. You could do EVERYTHING right—follow every rule, hire experts, triple-check safety—and STILL be liable! Usually this is for super dangerous stuff that the government wants to discourage.

---

## 📜 Res Ipsa Loquitur (6:45 - 7:00)

> 💡 **From Transcript (397.12s-403.44s):** "There's also a concept you should know called Res Ipsa Loquiter."

> 💡 **From Transcript (403.28s-409.28s):** "This means that if harm would it normally occur without negligence and the defendant had exclusive control."

> 💡 **From Transcript (409.28s-415.04s):** "they need to prove why they weren't negligent."

> 💡 **From Transcript (415.04s-421.28s):** "So it shifts that burden of proof onto the defendant and not the plaintiff."

| Res Ipsa Loquitur |
|------------------|
| Latin for "**The thing speaks for itself**" |
| Applies when: |
| 1. Harm wouldn't normally occur without negligence |
| 2. Defendant had exclusive control |
| **Shifts burden of proof to defendant** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> "Res Ipsa Loquitur" = "The thing speaks for itself"
> 
> Some accidents are SO obvious that they scream "someone was careless!" Example: A surgeon leaves a sponge inside you. That doesn't happen if the surgeon is careful! So the court says to the surgeon: "Explain yourself! Prove you WEREN'T careless."
> 
> The defendant has to prove innocence instead of the plaintiff proving guilt.

## 🧠 Quick Memory Hooks - Part 3

> [!TIP]
> **Memory Tricks:**
> - **Intentional = "I meant it" = NOT insured!**
> - **Unintentional = "Oops" = CAN be insured**
> - **Pool Push:** "Even joking can be intentional!"
> - **Tortfeasor = "Tort-DOER"** (person who did the tort)
> - **Res Ipsa = "It speaks for itself"** (obvious negligence)
> - **Liability Hierarchy:**
>   - Regular liability (prove negligence)
>   - Strict liability (dangerous = auto liable)
>   - Absolute liability (even with due diligence = STILL liable)
