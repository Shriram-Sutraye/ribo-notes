## 👶 Liability of Children (11:00 - 11:23)

> 💡 **From Transcript (712.88s-719.04s):** "Next let's talk about liability of children. Children are generally responsible for their own actions unless you can prove that they lack an understanding of the consequences."

| Children's Liability |
|---------------------|
| Children ARE responsible for their own actions |
| UNLESS they lack understanding of consequences |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Kids CAN be held responsible! A 15-year-old throwing rocks at cars knows it's wrong. But a 4-year-old might not understand. The question is: "Did the child understand what they were doing?"

---

### When Parents ARE Liable for Children

> 💡 **From Transcript (719.04s-724.24s):** "Parents are generally not liable for the actions of their children unless they fail to supervise the child."

> 💡 **From Transcript (725.12s-729.439s):** "The damage was caused by a dangerous object given to the child by the parents."

> 💡 **From Transcript (729.439s-734.88s):** "The child is acting on the authority of the parents or if the child is working at the parent's business and if the damage is resulted from duties given to the child."

| Parents Liable When: |
|---------------------|
| 1. **Failed to supervise** the child |
| 2. Gave child a **dangerous object** that caused damage |
| 3. Child was **acting on parents' authority** |
| 4. Child was **working at parents' business** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Parents usually AREN'T liable for their kids. But they ARE liable if:
> 1. "You should've been watching them!" (failed to supervise)
> 2. "You gave them a BB gun and they shot a window!" (dangerous object)
> 3. "You told them to do it!" (acting on authority)
> 4. "Your kid was running your store and messed up!" (working for parent)

## 🧹 Bailee for Hire (12:26 - 12:38)

> 💡 **From Transcript (746.72s-752.24s):** "A bailee for hire is someone who has temporary custody of the property of others for purpose other than sale and that they are compensated for it."

> 💡 **From Transcript (752.24s-758.64s):** "Examples include dry cleaners who clean your clothes or storage people."

| Bailee for Hire |
|----------------|
| Has **temporary custody** of others' property |
| For purpose **OTHER THAN sale** |
| They are **compensated** for it |

### 📋 Transcript Examples: Bailees

| Examples |
|---------|
| **Dry cleaners** - cleaning your clothes |
| **Storage facilities** - storing your stuff |
| Mechanics, valet parking, coat checks |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> A "bailee" holds YOUR stuff for a while. They're not buying it—just keeping it temporarily. If they damage or lose your stuff, they can be liable. Examples:
> - Dry cleaner ruins your shirt
> - Storage company floods and destroys your furniture
> - Valet crashes your car

## 👔 Employer's Liability for Employees (12:46 - 13:30)

> 💡 **From Transcript (758.64s-766.08s):** "Next I want to discuss employers liability for employees. So when employers are generally considered by carelessly liable for employee torts while they're in the course of business."

| Employer Liability for Employees |
|--------------------------------|
| Employers ARE liable for employee torts |
| **Condition:** While in course of business |
| This is called **VICARIOUS LIABILITY** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> If your employee harms someone WHILE doing their job, YOU (the employer) are on the hook. This is "vicarious liability"—you're responsible for what your workers do on the job.

---

### When Employers Are NOT Liable

> 💡 **From Transcript (766.08s-771.28s):** "However employers would not be liable when employees delegate their duties to someone else without the employers consent."

> 💡 **From Transcript (771.28s-778.24s):** "The employee is on a frolic of their own, meaning an authorized time away from the business."

> 💡 **From Transcript (778.32s-783.52s):** "or if the damage was caused by the unauthorized use of the employer's property."

| Employers NOT Liable When: |
|---------------------------|
| 1. Employee delegated to someone without consent |
| 2. Employee was on a **"frolic of their own"** |
| 3. Unauthorized use of employer's property |

---

### 📋 Transcript Example: Frolic of Their Own

> 💡 **From Transcript (783.52s-790.0s):** "So I want to talk a little bit more about frolic of their own."

> 💡 **From Transcript (790.0s-796.16s):** "If you send your manager to go to the bank and make a deposit and your manager hit somebody with their car on the way to the bank, the employer would be vicariously liable because the managers in the course of their duties."

> 💡 **From Transcript (797.36s-802.16s):** "However, if on the way back from the bank, the manager decides to make an unauthorized detour to Starbucks to get a cup of coffee and on the way to Starbucks, they hit someone with a car."

> 💡 **From Transcript (807.28s-813.439s):** "The employer would not be liable because the employee is considered to be on a frolic of their own."

| Frolic Example - Manager to Bank |
|--------------------------------|
| **Going TO bank:** Manager hits someone → Employer LIABLE |
| **On way back, detours to Starbucks:** Manager hits someone → Employer NOT liable |
| **Why:** Starbucks was unauthorized "frolic" |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> "Frolic of their own" = doing personal stuff on company time.
> 
> - Boss sends you to bank → you hit someone → BOSS is liable
> - You stop at Starbucks on the way (not authorized) → you hit someone → YOU are liable, not boss
> 
> The moment you go "off-script" for personal reasons, your boss isn't responsible anymore!

## 🤕 Employer's Liability for Employee Injuries (13:50 - 14:20)

> 💡 **From Transcript (818.64s-830.64s):** "Next is the employer's liability for employee injuries. The legal duty of employers are established in the Workers Compensation Act and employers are generally liable for their employees' injuries."

| Workers Compensation Act |
|-------------------------|
| Establishes employer duties |
| Employers generally liable for employee injuries |

---

### No-Fault Basis

> 💡 **From Transcript (831.36s-836.959s):** "Any compensation provided by the Workers Compensation Act is given on a no-fault basis."

> 💡 **From Transcript (837.28s-843.44s):** "That means the employee does not need to prove that the employer was negligent."

> 💡 **From Transcript (843.44s-848.88s):** "and if they accept the money, they cannot sue the employer anymore."

| Workers Comp - No Fault |
|------------------------|
| Employee does NOT need to prove negligence |
| If employee accepts money |
| They **CANNOT sue** employer |
| "Trade-off" |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Workers' Compensation is a deal:
> - **For employees:** You get money automatically, no need to prove your boss was negligent
> - **For employers:** Once employees take the money, they can't sue you
> 
> It's a trade! Quick, easy money for employees, but no lawsuits for employers.

---

### If Workers' Comp Doesn't Cover

> 💡 **From Transcript (848.88s-854.56s):** "If Workers Compensation does not cover the injury, of course the employee can still sue the employer."

> 💡 **From Transcript (854.56s-859.84s):** "If your employee is not covered by Workers Compensation, you can either enroll them manually."

> 💡 **From Transcript (861.36s-866.96s):** "or you can purchase an employer's liability rider to protect the employer against any liability that might arise due to employee injuries."

| If Not Covered |
|---------------|
| Employee CAN still sue employer |
| Options: |
| 1. Enroll employee manually in WC |
| 2. Purchase **Employer's Liability Rider** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Not all employees are covered by Workers' Comp (like some independent contractors). If they're not covered and get hurt, they CAN sue you! Protect yourself by either adding them to Workers' Comp OR buying an "employer's liability rider" on your insurance.

---

## 🔧 Independent Contractors (14:40 - 15:07)

> 💡 **From Transcript (872.88s-882.0s):** "What about your liability if you hire an independent contractor? You're generally not liable for your contractors' negligence."

| Independent Contractors |
|------------------------|
| Generally **NOT liable** for their negligence |
| They're independent! |

---

### When You ARE Liable for Contractors

> 💡 **From Transcript (882.0s-886.56s):** "except when the work is inherently dangerous, like dynamite a tree stump."

> 💡 **From Transcript (886.56s-891.84s):** "when you supply defective materials or equipment or when you control the work."

> 💡 **From Transcript (891.84s-896.72s):** "When you control the work, they're not independent anymore."

> 💡 **From Transcript (896.72s-902.72s):** "The work must also be reasonable and the insured must have been very careful in selecting the contractor."

> 💡 **From Transcript (902.72s-907.68s):** "You can't just pick anyone really nearly."

| Liable for Contractors When: |
|----------------------------|
| 1. Work is **inherently dangerous** (e.g., dynamite) |
| 2. You supplied **defective materials/equipment** |
| 3. You **controlled the work** (then they're not independent!) |
| 4. You didn't **carefully select** the contractor |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Hire a contractor? Usually their mistakes are THEIR problem, not yours. BUT you're liable if:
> - The job was super dangerous (blasting, demolition)
> - You gave them faulty equipment
> - You micromanaged so much they weren't really "independent"
> - You hired a terrible contractor without checking credentials

---

## 🐕 Liability for Animals (15:07 - 15:26)

> 💡 **From Transcript (909.04s-914.48s):** "Now what about liability for animals? Animals are broken down into two categories. You have domestic animals and you have wild animals."

> 💡 **From Transcript (914.48s-919.84s):** "In some provinces there might also be a dangerous dog's act which might require you to purchase insurance."

| Animal Categories |
|------------------|
| **Domestic animals** (pets) |
| **Wild animals** (exotic, zoo animals) |
| Some provinces have **Dangerous Dogs Act** |

---

### Domestic vs Wild Animal Liability

> 💡 **From Transcript (919.84s-926.24s):** "For domestic animals, the owner is considered liable on the first bite."

> 💡 **From Transcript (926.32s-932.32s):** "For wild animals, the owner is strictly liable for any damage caused by that animal."

| Domestic Animals | Wild Animals |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Liable on **FIRST BITE** | **Strictly liable** for ANY damage |
| One-bite "warning" | No warnings! |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> - **Dog/Cat (domestic):** Your dog bites someone? First time, you might get a pass. Second time, you're DEFINITELY liable.
> - **Lion/Snake (wild):** You chose to keep a dangerous animal. First bite? You're liable. The law gives NO passes for wild animals!

---

## 🤝 Joint Liability (15:26 - 15:37)

> 💡 **From Transcript (932.32s-940.0s):** "Join liability exists when multiple parties act negligently together. When liabilities distributed unequally, the law holds each party fully responsible."

> 💡 **From Transcript (940.0s-945.6s):** "That means each party can actually be liable for up to 100% of the damage as if they have acted alone."

> 💡 **From Transcript (945.6s-951.28s):** "So this encourages the two parties to just go 50-50 and then sort it out later."

> 💡 **From Transcript (951.92s-957.92s):** "That way the plaintiff gets compensated first."

| Joint Liability |
|----------------|
| Multiple parties act negligently |
| EACH can be liable for **100%** |
| Encourages parties to split and settle |
| Plaintiff gets paid first! |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Two people caused your injury? Each one can be on the hook for the FULL amount! If the court says you're owed $100,000 and one wrongdoer is broke, you can collect the WHOLE $100,000 from the other one.
> 
> This encourages the wrongdoers to split costs voluntarily, because otherwise ONE might pay everything.
