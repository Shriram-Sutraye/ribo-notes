## 🧠 Practice Question

> A broker has a client with a complex commercial risk that exceeds their binding authority. Which department should the broker contact FIRST?
> 
> a) Claims  
> b) Finance  
> c) Underwriting  
> d) Administration

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer: c) Underwriting**

Underwriting is responsible for:
- Evaluating risks
- Approving risks outside binding authority
- Setting terms and pricing

The broker needs underwriting approval to bind this complex risk.

**Why not the others:**
- a) Claims handles losses after they occur, not new business
