## What Are Investigation Considerations?

When assessing a client's risk, a broker must **investigate** several factors to understand the full picture. These considerations help you determine:
- How risky is this client?
- What coverage do they need?
- How should it be priced?

---

## The 4 Key Considerations

| Factor | What to Look At |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Loss History** | Past claims and losses |
| **Physical Characteristics** | The actual property/asset features |
| **Protection** | Safety measures in place |
| **Liability Factors** | Potential for being sued |

---

## 1️⃣ Loss History

**Definition:** The record of past claims, losses, and near-misses.

### Why It Matters:
> **Past behavior predicts future behavior.** If a client has had multiple claims, they're statistically more likely to have more.

### What to Look For:
| ✅ Good Signs | ❌ Red Flags |
|---------------|-------------|
| No claims in 5+ years | Multiple claims in short time |
| Minor claims only | Large, expensive claims |
| Claims not their fault | Pattern of negligence |

### Example:
> **Client A:** No claims in 10 years  
> **Client B:** 3 water damage claims in 2 years
> 
> Who is riskier? **Client B** — their loss history shows a pattern.

> 💡 **Exam Tip:** Poor loss history = higher premiums or declined coverage.

## 2️⃣ Physical Characteristics

**Definition:** The physical features of the property or asset being insured.

### What to Examine:

| For Buildings | For Vehicles | For Equipment |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| Construction type (wood vs. brick) | Year/make/model | Age and condition |
| Age of building | Safety features (ABS, airbags) | Maintenance records |
| Roof condition | Mileage | Usage intensity |
| Electrical/plumbing | Where it's parked | Storage conditions |
| Fire-resistant materials | Anti-theft devices | Value/replacement cost |

### Example:
> **Two identical-looking houses:**
> 
> | House A | House B |
> |---------|---------|
> | Brick construction | Wood frame |
> | New roof (2024) | Original roof (1985) |
> | Updated electrical | Knob-and-tube wiring |
> 
> **House A** is less risky due to better physical characteristics = lower premium.

---

## 3️⃣ Protection

**Definition:** The safety measures, security systems, and precautions in place to prevent or minimize loss.

### Types of Protection:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Fire Protection** | Smoke detectors, sprinklers, fire extinguishers |
| **Security** | Alarm systems, cameras, deadbolts, security guards |
| **Safety Procedures** | Employee training, fire drills, maintenance schedules |
| **Location** | Distance to fire hydrant, fire station |

### Example:
> **Two retail stores:**
> 
> | Store A | Store B |
> |---------|---------|
> | No alarm system | Monitored alarm + cameras |
> | No fire sprinklers | Full sprinkler system |
> | No employee training | Annual safety training |
> 
> **Store B** has better protection = lower risk = lower premium.

> 💡 **Broker Tip:** Recommend protection improvements to help clients lower their premiums!

## 4️⃣ Liability Factors

**Definition:** Characteristics that increase the chance of being held legally responsible for someone else's loss.

### Common Liability Factors:

| Factor | Why It Increases Risk |
|--------|----------------------|
| **High foot traffic** | More people = more chances for accidents |
| **Dangerous products** | Defective products can cause injury |
| **Hazardous operations** | Construction, chemicals = higher risk |
| **Swimming pools** | Drowning risk, especially with children |
| **Dogs (certain breeds)** | Higher bite liability |
| **Alcohol service** | Liquor liability if patron drives drunk |

### Example:
> **Comparing two businesses:**
> 
> | Accounting Firm | Nightclub |
> |-----------------|-----------|
> | Low foot traffic | Hundreds of visitors nightly |
> | No physical products | Serves alcohol |
> | Quiet office work | Dancing, crowds, potential fights |
> 
> **The nightclub** has significantly higher liability factors.

## 📝 Quick Reference Table

| Consideration | Key Question | Impact |
|---------------|--------------|--------|
| **Loss History** | "What's happened before?" | Predicts future claims |
| **Physical Characteristics** | "What is it made of?" | Determines damage susceptibility |
| **Protection** | "What prevents loss?" | Reduces risk & premium |
| **Liability Factors** | "What could cause a lawsuit?" | Identifies coverage needs |

## 🧠 Practice Question

> A broker is assessing a commercial property. The building is 80 years old with original wiring, has had 2 fire claims in the past 5 years, has no sprinkler system, and is located 10km from the nearest fire station.
> 
> **Which investigation considerations show RED FLAGS?**
> 
> a) Loss History only  
> b) Physical Characteristics only  
> c) Protection only  
> d) All of the above

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer: d) All of the above**

- **Loss History:** 2 fire claims in 5 years = red flag 🚩
- **Physical Characteristics:** 80 years old + original wiring = red flag 🚩
- **Protection:** No sprinkler system + far from fire station = red flag 🚩

This property would likely face higher premiums or coverage restrictions.
