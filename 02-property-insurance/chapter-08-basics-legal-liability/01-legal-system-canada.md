## 🏛️ Why Laws Exist (0:00 - 0:18)

> 💡 **From Transcript (0.0s-12.0s):** "If we want to understand legal liability, we first have to understand the legal system in Canada."

> 💡 **From Transcript (12.0s-18.8s):** "So laws exist to establish a standard of conduct. Basically tells us when we can or cannot do."

| Purpose of Laws |
|----------------|
| Establish a **standard of conduct** |
| Tell us what we CAN and CANNOT do |
| Create rules everyone must follow |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Laws are like the "rules of the game" for society. Just like a sport has rules about what you can and can't do, society has laws. Without them, it would be chaos—anyone could do anything! Laws set boundaries so everyone knows what's acceptable.

## ⚖️ Two Types of Legal Systems in Canada (0:18 - 0:41)

> 💡 **From Transcript (18.8s-25.28s):** "Within Canada, we have two main types of legal systems. We have criminal law and we have civil law also known as private law."

| Two Legal Systems |
|------------------|
| **1. Criminal Law** |
| **2. Civil Law** (also called Private Law) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Think of it this way:
> - **Criminal Law** = The government vs. a bad person (crimes against society)
> - **Civil Law** = Person vs. person (disputes between individuals or companies)

---

## 🚔 Criminal Law (0:25 - 0:49)

> 💡 **From Transcript (25.52s-31.2s):** "So criminal law violations is something that is not insurable because criminal law addresses wrongs against society by punishing the wrongdoer."

> 💡 **From Transcript (31.76s-36.08s):** "whether that's with fines, penalties, imprisonment, probation, all number of legal remedies."

| Criminal Law |
|-------------|
| Addresses **wrongs against SOCIETY** |
| Punishes the wrongdoer |
| **NOT insurable!** |

### Punishments for Criminal Law Violations

| Punishment Type | Example |
|----------------|---------|
| Fines | Pay $5,000 penalty |
| Penalties | Driver's license suspension |
| Imprisonment | Jail time |
| Probation | Supervised release |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Criminal law is when you do something SO BAD that the whole society is harmed—like theft, assault, or murder. The government prosecutes you (not another person). You can go to JAIL. And most importantly for insurance: **YOU CANNOT INSURE AGAINST CRIMES!**
> 
> Why? Because if you could insure crime, people might commit more crimes since they'd have no consequences. That would be crazy!

---

### Goal of Criminal Law

> 💡 **From Transcript (43.28s-49.52s):** "The goal of criminal law is to determine guilt or innocence."

| Criminal Law Goal |
|------------------|
| Determine if you are **GUILTY** or **INNOCENT** |
| Binary outcome: You did it or you didn't |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Criminal trials answer ONE question: "Did this person commit the crime?" Either you're guilty and get punished, or you're innocent and go free. There's no middle ground—it's yes or no.

---

## 📋 Civil Law / Private Law (0:49 - 1:11)

> 💡 **From Transcript (49.52s-54.64s):** "So civil law addresses disputes between parties and the resolution is to compensate the wrong party somehow."

| Civil Law |
|-----------|
| Addresses **disputes between parties** |
| Goal: **COMPENSATE** the wrong party |
| Also called "Private Law" |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Civil law is like a referee settling an argument between two people. It's not about punishment—it's about making the injured person "whole" again. If I crash my car into your fence, you sue me and the court decides how much I owe you to fix it. No one goes to jail!

---

### How Civil Law Works

> 💡 **From Transcript (54.8s-59.84s):** "This involves interpreting and developing common law principles and applying statute laws where relevant."

> 💡 **From Transcript (59.84s-65.92s):** "Courts are only involved with the wrong party initiates an action against the wrongdoer."

> 💡 **From Transcript (65.92s-71.039s):** "Meaning somebody has to sue somebody, say, for breach of contract for example."

| How Civil Law Works |
|--------------------|
| Courts interpret common law principles |
| Apply statute laws where relevant |
| **Courts only get involved if someone SUES** |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Breach of Contract

| Scenario |
|----------|
| Person A hires Person B to build a fence |
| Person B takes the money but doesn't build the fence |
| Person A has to SUE Person B to get resolution |
| Court will order: Return money OR build the fence |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Unlike criminal law where police investigate automatically, civil law requires YOU to take action. If someone wrongs you, the court won't do anything until you file a lawsuit. You have to SUE them. The court then decides who's right and how much the loser pays.

## 📚 Common Law vs Statute Law (1:11 - 2:11)

> 💡 **From Transcript (72.64s-78.32s):** "When it comes to the application of civil law, this is based on either common law or statute law."

| Two Bases for Civil Law |
|------------------------|
| **1. Common Law** (precedent-based) |
| **2. Statute Law** (written law) |

---

### 📖 Common Law (Precedent-Based)

> 💡 **From Transcript (79.039s-84.96s):** "Common law is something based on precedence. Also known as the doctrine or rule of precedence."

> 💡 **From Transcript (85.6s-90.559s):** "This means that the courts will try to follow previous rulings in civil or cases to create a consistent standard of conduct."

| Common Law |
|-----------|
| Based on **PRECEDENCE** |
| = The doctrine/rule of precedence |
| Courts follow PREVIOUS rulings |
| Creates consistent standards |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Following Previous Rulings

| How Common Law Works |
|---------------------|
| Case A: Court ruled landlord is liable for broken railing |
| Case B: Similar situation occurs |
| Court looks at Case A and rules the same way |
| Creates CONSISTENCY across similar cases |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Common law is like following traditions. If a judge ruled on a similar case 50 years ago, today's judge will likely rule the same way. It's like a sports referee saying "we've always called this a foul, so we'll call it a foul again." This keeps things fair and predictable.

---

### Can Precedents Be Changed?

> 💡 **From Transcript (97.679s-103.759s):** "Precedence can be overturned and replaced with a newly established one because it may no longer be socially, legally or equitably applicable, meaning is no longer fair."

> 💡 **From Transcript (103.84s-111.2s):** "given the current society."

| Changing Precedence |
|--------------------|
| Precedents CAN be overturned |
| Replaced with new precedent |
| When old ruling is: |
| - Not socially applicable |
| - Not legally applicable |
| - Not equitably (fairly) applicable |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Society changes! A court ruling from 1890 might be totally unfair today. For example, old laws discriminated against certain groups. Modern courts can say "that old ruling doesn't match our values anymore" and create a NEW precedent. The law evolves with society.

---

### 📜 Statute Law (Written Law)

> 💡 **From Transcript (111.2s-115.84s):** "Besides common law or the rule of precedence, we also have statute law, which is written law."

> 💡 **From Transcript (115.84s-120.8s):** "These are laws that are created by legislation through bills and are meant to regulate certain activities."

| Statute Law |
|------------|
| **Written law** |
| Created by legislation (Parliament/Provincial) |
| Created through BILLS |
| Meant to regulate specific activities |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Statute law is the law that politicians write and vote on. It's written down in books (like the Criminal Code, Insurance Act, etc.). These are the laws you can actually read. Common law is judge-made; statute law is politician-made.

---

### 🔥 KEY RULE: Statute Law ALWAYS Wins!

> 💡 **From Transcript (120.8s-131.12s):** "Where there's a conflict between statute law and common law, statute law supersedes always. So rulings on civil law are based on either common law or statute."

| The Golden Rule |
|----------------|
| If statute law and common law CONFLICT |
| **STATUTE LAW WINS** |
| Statute law supersedes (overrides) common law |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This is a KEY EXAM POINT:**
> If there's ever a conflict between what judges have ruled in the past (common law) and what's written in legislation (statute law), the WRITTEN LAW always takes priority!

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Think of it this way:
> - Common law = Traditions and past rulings
> - Statute law = Written rules from government
> 
> If the tradition says one thing but the written rule says another, the WRITTEN RULE wins. Written law beats tradition every time!
