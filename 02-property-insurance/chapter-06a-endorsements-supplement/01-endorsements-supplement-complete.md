> **Timestamp:** 0:00 - 20:00 (0s - 1199s) | **Video Duration:** ~20 minutes

This chapter covers **additional property insurance coverages** and **endorsements** that can be added to your property policy.

---

## 🎯 The Big Picture

> 🎯 **Plain English:** This chapter is all about "add-ons" for your home insurance. Some people have special situations (second homes, cottages, Airbnbs) that need extra coverage. Plus, there are endorsements (optional upgrades) like earthquake, sewer backup, and coverage for expensive items.

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (The Big Picture):**
> Standard home insurance doesn't cover everything. This chapter teaches you:
> - How to insure your **second house** or **cottage**
> - How to insure **Airbnb rentals**
> - How to add **earthquake, sewer backup, jewellery, and fine art** coverage
> - Special rules for **vacant houses**
> - Coverage for **boats, computers, and home businesses**

## 🏘️ Part 1: Secondary Dwelling Insurance (0:00 - 2:16)

> 💡 **From Transcript (0.0s-27.84s):** "So in this section, we're going to go over some additional property insurance coverages and also some endorsements that you can tag on to your property coverage. The first thing I'm going to talk about is secondary dwellings. This insurance is for people who own a second dwelling that's rented to other people, but they're unable to get homeowners for that building."

### What is Secondary Dwelling Insurance?

| Secondary Dwelling Insurance |
|------------------------------|
| For people who own a second home |
| That's rented to other people |
| Unable to get standard homeowners |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You bought a rental property. It's NOT your main home, and you rent it out. Regular homeowners insurance won't cover it, so you need "Secondary Dwelling Insurance."

---

### 🧠 Deep Explanation: Understanding Secondary Dwelling Insurance

#### 📌 What Problem Does It Solve?

**Normal Situation:** You have ONE home → You buy **homeowners insurance** → Done! ✅

**Problem Situation:**
1. You buy a **second property** (not your main home)
2. You **rent it out** to tenants
3. You try to buy "homeowners insurance" for it...
4. Insurance company says: **"NOPE! This isn't YOUR home. It's a rental property."** ❌

**Why do they refuse?**
- Homeowners insurance is designed for **owner-occupied** properties (you live there)
- A rental property has **different risks** (tenants don't care for it like you would, higher damage potential)
- A rental property is essentially a **business activity** (you're earning income)

#### 🎯 The Solution: Secondary Dwelling Insurance

This is a **specialized policy** for exactly this situation:
- ✅ You own the building
- ✅ You **don't live there** (it's your 2nd property)
- ✅ **Tenants live there** (you rent it out)
- ❌ You can't get regular homeowners insurance for it

### 📖 Real-World Ontario Examples (2026)

#### Example 1: The Out-of-Town Rental

**Scenario:**
Sarah lives in Brampton and inherited her uncle's old house in Hamilton. She doesn't want to sell it, so she rents it to a college student for $1,500/month.

**Problem:** Sarah already has homeowners insurance on her Brampton house (her primary home). But the Hamilton house isn't her "home"—it's an investment/rental property. Insurance companies won't give her regular homeowners insurance.

**Solution:** Sarah buys **Secondary Dwelling Insurance** for the Hamilton property. This covers:
- The building itself (roof, walls, foundation)
- Her stuff left in the house (old furniture, appliances)
- Lost rental income if the house becomes uninhabitable

---

#### Example 2: The Multi-Property Landlord

**Scenario:**
Ahmed lives in Toronto. He bought a rental duplex in Scarborough. He rents both units to families.

**Problem:** This is 100% a rental property—Ahmed doesn't live in either unit. Standard homeowners insurance is designed for your MAIN residence where YOU live.

**Solution:** Ahmed needs **Secondary Dwelling Insurance**. This specialized policy:
- Covers damage to the duplex building
- Covers detached structures (garage, shed) proportionally
- Covers fair rental value if tenants can't pay rent because of damage

---

### 📋 Coverage Breakdown (What You Actually Get)

#### **Coverage A: The Building (Dwelling)**

| What's Covered | What's NOT Covered |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Walls, roof, foundation | Plants/fixtures temporarily removed (different from homeowners!) |
| Attached garage | |
| Built-in appliances | |

**Extensions (10% of Coverage A limit):**

| Extension | Real Example |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Fixtures temporarily removed** | You take the chandelier down for repairs → still covered |
| **Detached private structures** | Your rental has a shed + garage → both covered proportionally |
| **Fair rental value** | Fire makes property uninhabitable → insurance pays you the lost rent |

**The Proportional Rule Explained:**
- Total value of all structures = $100,000
- Garage = $10,000 (10% of total)
- Extension limit = $10,000 (10% of Coverage A)
- Garage coverage = $1,000 (10% of the $10,000 extension)

---

#### **Coverage C: Personal Property (Your Stuff)**

This covers **your belongings** left in the rental property:
- Old furniture
- Appliances (washer, dryer, fridge)
- Tools in the garage

**Extensions (10% of Coverage C limit):**

| Extension | Real Example |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Uninsured property of others** | Tenant has no insurance → their laptop breaks → covered (limited) |
| **Temporarily removed property** | You take the TV to your main home → still covered (Canada/US only) |
| **Additional living expenses** | If YOU had to relocate because of the property issue → covered |

---

### 🤔 Why This Is Different From Homeowners Insurance

| Feature | Homeowners Insurance | Secondary Dwelling |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Who lives there?** | YOU (owner-occupied) | Tenants (rented out) |
| **Purpose** | Your primary residence | Investment/income property |
| **Risk level** | Lower (you take care of it) | Higher (tenants may not) |
| **Coverage for plants temporarily removed** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Vandalism** | Usually included | Usually EXCLUDED (needs endorsement) |

---

### ⚠️ Key Points for RIBO Exam

1. **Secondary Dwelling ≠ Seasonal Dwelling**
   - Secondary = **Rented out to others**, NOT occupied by owner
   - Seasonal = **Your cottage/vacation home** (you use it sometimes)

2. **Extensions are 10% of the main coverage limit**
   - Coverage A = $100,000 → Extensions = $10,000

3. **Proportional rule for multiple structures**
   - If garage = 15% of total structure value, it gets 15% of the extension limit

4. **Fair Rental Value**
   - If fire damages the house and tenant can't pay rent → insurance pays YOU the lost rent

5. **Vandalism typically excluded** (covered separately if shown on declarations page) because owner isn't there to monitor the property

---

### 💡 The "Unable to Get Homeowners" Part Explained

The transcript says: _"This insurance is for people who own a second dwelling that's rented to other people, **but they're unable to get homeowners for that building**."_

**Translation:**
- Insurance companies have **specific products for specific situations**
- You can't just use "homeowners insurance" for everything
- A rental property = different risk profile = needs a different policy
- Secondary Dwelling Insurance exists BECAUSE homeowners insurance won't cover rental properties

Think of it like car insurance:
- You can't use personal auto insurance for a taxi/Uber
- You need **commercial auto insurance** for that
- Same logic: You can't use "home" insurance for a "rental business"

---

### Coverage A: Dwelling Building

> 💡 **From Transcript (27.84s-55.8s):** "So the first coverage you get is Coverage A for the dwelling building. You get the same coverage as we've discussed in the previous homeowners policies, minus plants and fixtures that are temporarily removed. But you do get three extensions of coverage with a limit equal to 10% of whatever limit you purchased for Coverage A. So if your Coverage A limit is $100,000, your limit for these extensions is $10,000."

| Coverage A |
|------------|
| Same as homeowners |
| MINUS plants and fixtures temporarily removed |
| Extensions: 10% of Coverage A |

### 📋 Transcript Example: $100,000 Coverage A

| If Coverage A = $100,000 |
|-------------------------|
| Extension limit = $10,000 (10%) |

---

### 3 Extensions of Coverage (10% of Coverage A)

> 💡 **From Transcript (55.8s-90.28s):** "The first extension is for fixtures that are temporarily removed for repairs or for storage. The second extension is for detached private structures. If you have multiple detached private structures, the limit for any one structure is the proportion of that structure to the total value. So if your garage makes up 10% of your total structure value, your garage will get 10% of the limit. The third extension you get is fair rental value and it works exactly the same as what we've discussed previously."

| # | Extension | Notes |
|---|-----------|-------|
| 1 | Fixtures temporarily removed | For repairs or storage |
| 2 | Detached private structures | Proportional to total value |
| 3 | Fair rental value | Lost rent if uninhabitable |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Garage = 10% of Total

| Scenario |
|----------|
| You have multiple structures |
| Garage = 10% of total structure value |
| Garage gets 10% of the 10% extension limit |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Extensions):**
> 1. **Fixtures Removed**: You take down the chandelier for repairs. Still covered (up to 10% of home value).
> 2. **Detached Structures**: Your shed and garage—covered proportionally.
> 3. **Fair Rental Value**: Tenant can't pay rent because house is damaged? Insurance pays you the lost rent.

---

### Coverage C: Personal Property

> 💡 **From Transcript (90.28s-136.36s):** "The next coverage you get is Coverage C for personal property and it works exactly the same way as before. You also get extensions of coverage with a limit of 10% of whatever limit you got for Coverage C. The first extension is for uninsured personal property of others. The second extension is for personal property that's temporarily removed but you'll only have coverage while that property is in Canada or in the continental United States. The third extension is for additional living expenses."

| Coverage C Extensions (10% of C) |
|----------------------------------|
| 1. Uninsured personal property of others |
| 2. Temporarily removed property (Canada/continental US only) |
| 3. Additional living expenses |

**Same Special Limits as Homeowners:**
- Business property
- Tractors
- Watercraft

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Coverage C):**
> Your rental property has your old furniture in it. If it's damaged, Coverage C covers it. Plus:
> - Your tenant's stuff (if they have no insurance)
> - Your stuff if you moved it out temporarily
> - Extra living costs if you have to relocate

---

## 🏕️ Part 2: Seasonal Dwelling Insurance (2:16 - 7:33)

> 💡 **From Transcript (136.36s-144.64s):** "So seasonal dwelling insurance is typically a named peril policy. That means it only covers the perils that are named on the policy."

### Seasonal Dwelling Basics

| Seasonal Dwelling |
|-------------------|
| Named Perils policy |
| Only covers listed perils |
| Similar to secondary dwellings |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your cottage by the lake? That's a "seasonal dwelling." It ONLY covers specific things listed in the policy. If it's not on the list, you're out of luck.

---

### The 11 Named Perils for Seasonal Dwellings

> 💡 **From Transcript (144.64s-303.0s):** Detailed list of 11 named perils.

| # | Named Peril | Details |
|---|-------------|---------|
| 1 | **Fire & Lightning** | Including lightning damage to electrical devices |
| 2 | **Artificial Electricity** | Power surges |
| 3 | **Explosion** | Boilers included, water hammer excluded |
| 4 | **Smoke** | From sudden, unusual, faulty operation of cooking/heating |
| 5 | **Falling Object** | Exterior only, excludes earth movement/snow slides |
| 6 | **Windstorm & Hail** | Excludes interior/contents unless hole opened by storm |
| 7 | **Impact by Aircraft/Landcraft** | Car/plane hits building (pets excluded) |

| 9 | **Water Damage** | Same as comprehensive/tenant/condo forms |
| 10 | **Burglary/Robbery** | If shown on dec page |
| 11 | **Vandalism** | If shown on dec page |

---

### Windstorm & Hail Exclusions

> 💡 **From Transcript (172.08s-195.92s):** "Windstorm and hail damage is covered but it excludes damage to the interior and contents unless there was a hole open by the storm or hail. Damaged outdoor antenna or attachments are not covered and neither is damaged caused by the weight of ice or snow, waves or flood. And also any windstorm or hail damage defenses would not be covered."

| Windstorm/Hail Excludes |
|------------------------|
| Interior/contents (unless hole opened by storm) |
| Outdoor antenna/attachments |
| Weight of ice or snow |
| Waves or flood |
| Fences |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Hail breaks your roof and makes a hole? Covered. Water comes in through that hole? Covered. Your fence blows over? NOT covered. Antenna falls off? NOT covered.

---

### Impact by Aircraft/Landcraft (Cars)

> 💡 **From Transcript (201.76s-210.799s):** "The next insured peril is impacted by aircraft or by landcraft, basically a car. However damaged to pets are excluded. So if your pet gets hit by a car there is no coverage but if your building gets hit by a car you will have coverage."

### 📋 Transcript Example: Pet vs Building

| Scenario | Covered? |
|----------|----------|
| Building hit by car | ✅ Yes |
| Pet hit by car | ❌ No |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> A car crashes into your cottage? Covered. A car hits your dog? NOT covered.

---

### Burglary vs Robbery (Shown on Dec Page)

> 💡 **From Transcript (224.799s-260.36s):** "So burglary is defined as theft following illegal, forcible entry or exit leaving visible marks. So there must be visible marks going in or out. For example scratches on the doors, broken windows, things like that. $500 of your Coverage C limit will go towards paying for building damage. The next coverage you get is robbery. Robbery means theft by violence or the threat of violence against a person."

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Burglary** | Theft with forcible entry/exit, VISIBLE MARKS |
| **Robbery** | Theft by violence or THREAT of violence |

| Burglary Building Damage |
|-------------------------|
| $500 of Coverage C pays for building damage |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Scratches & Broken Windows

| Visible Marks |
|---------------|
| Scratches on doors |
| Broken windows |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> - **Burglary**: Someone breaks in when you're NOT home. You can SEE the damage (broken window, kicked door).
> - **Robbery**: Someone threatens you with violence to steal your stuff. You're THERE when it happens.

---

### Burglary/Robbery Exclusions

> 💡 **From Transcript (260.36s-273.6s):** "Either way, the burglary or robbery coverage will exclude damage to pets. Damage while the building is under construction or vacant or damage to part of the building that's rented out if it was caused by the tenant, the member of the tenant's household or the tenants employee."

| Burglary/Robbery Excludes |
|--------------------------|
| Damage to pets |
| Building under construction |
| Vacant buildings |
| Damage by tenant/tenant's household/employee |

---

### Special Limits for Seasonal Dwellings

> 💡 **From Transcript (278.4s-296.64s):** "The special limits here are also very similar to the special limits under homeowners. Money in bullion is insured for $200 maximum. Jewellery, watches, and furs for $1,000. Numismatics meaning coin collections and coins for $100, manuscript/stamps for $500, silverware or pewterware for $5000, and securities for $1,000 max."

| Property | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| **Money/Bullion** | $200 |
| **Jewellery/Watches/Furs** | $1,000 |
| **Coins/Numismatics** | $100 |
| **Manuscripts/Stamps** | $500 |
| **Silverware/Pewterware** | $5,000 |
| **Securities** | $1,000 |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> These limits are LOWER than regular homeowners! At your cottage:
> - Cash? Only $200 max.
> - Your Rolex? Only $1,000 max.
> - Rare coins? Only $100 max.
> 
> **Don't leave expensive stuff at the cottage!**

---

### 🧠 Deep Dive: Do You Need to Memorize Special Limits for RIBO Exam?

#### ✅ SHORT ANSWER: YES, but the exam is now OPEN-BOOK (since Jan 2025)

This is good news! Since January 1, 2025, the RIBO Level 1 exam is **open-book**, meaning:
- You get access to policy wordings during the exam
- You can **look up** specific dollar amounts
- **BUT** you need to know **WHERE to find them quickly**

---

#### 🎯 What Reddit Says (Based on Real Test-Takers)

| What to Focus On | Priority |
|------------------|----------|
| **Co-insurance calculations** | 🔥 HIGH (multiple questions!) |
| **OPCFs (5, 6, 49, etc.)** | 🔥 HIGH |
| **Policy wording differences** (Homeowners vs Tenant vs Condo) | 🔥 HIGH |
| **Concepts behind limits** (WHY items are limited) | 🔥 HIGH |
| **Exact dollar amounts** | 🟡 MEDIUM (can look up, but know the ballpark) |

---

#### 💡 Know the PATTERN, Not Every Number

Instead of memorizing every dollar value, understand the **pattern**:

| Category | Typical Limit | WHY It's Low |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| **Money/Bullion** | $200 | Easy to steal, hard to prove |
| **Coins/Numismatics** | $100 | Easy to steal, debatable value |
| **Manuscripts/Stamps** | $500 | Collectibles, need appraisal |
| **Jewellery/Watches/Furs (theft)** | $1,000-$1,500 | Easy to steal, high value |
| **Securities** | $1,000 | Can be replaced (contact bank) |
| **Silverware/Pewterware** | $5,000 | Harder to steal (bulky) |

**Memory Trick:**
- **Smaller = Easier to steal = Lower limit** (coins, cash, jewelry)
- **Bigger = Harder to steal = Higher limit** (silverware)

---

#### 📌 What You MUST Know Cold (No Lookup Time)

These come up in **calculations and scenarios**, so memorize:

| Value | What It's For |
|-------|---------------|
| **10%** | Extension limits (10% of Coverage A or C) |
| **30 days** | Newly acquired items automatic coverage |
| **7 days** | Earthquake aftershock rule |
| **$500** | Building damage from burglary (from Coverage C) |
| **$100,000** | Common minimum for earthquake deductible |

---

#### 🎓 RIBO Exam Strategy (Open-Book)

Since it's open-book:
1. ✅ **Know the concepts** (what's covered, what's excluded, WHY)
2. ✅ **Know where to look** (which section of policy wording)
3. ❌ **Don't waste time** looking up every $200 vs $500 difference
4. 🔥 **Focus on calculations** (co-insurance, ACV vs RC)
5. 🔥 **Focus on OPCFs and auto** (heavily tested!)

---

#### 📝 Quick Cheat Sheet: Memory Tricks for Special Limits

| Item | Limit | Memory Trick |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Money/Bullion | $200 | "2 fingers can grab cash fast" |
| Coins | $100 | "Coins = 1 pocket = $100" |
| Stamps/Manuscripts | $500 | "5 letters in STAMP" |
| Jewellery/Furs (theft) | $1,000-1,500 | "Jewellery = Just 1K for theft" |
| Securities | $1,000 | "SECurities = SEC = 1000" |
| Silverware | $5,000 | "SILVER = 6 letters ≈ $5,000" |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Bottom Line:** Don't stress about memorizing every single dollar amount. Focus on:
> 1. Understanding WHY limits exist
> 2. Knowing the approximate range
> 3. Knowing how to find them quickly in policy wordings
> 4. Spending more time on **co-insurance calculations** and **OPCFs**

---

### Vandalism Exclusions

> 💡 **From Transcript (296.64s-330.68s):** "And the final coverage you get as part of the named perils is for vandalism or malicious acts. This excludes damage to seasonal dwellings or structures and its property. Damage while under construction or vacant. Damage caused by the insured damage to building glass. Actual or attempted theft, burglary or robbery. And damage attributable to a tenant, the tenants employee, the tenants household, or a tenants guest."

| Vandalism Excludes |
|-------------------|
| Damage to seasonal dwellings/structures |
| Under construction or vacant |
| Damage caused by the insured |
| Building glass |
| Theft/burglary/robbery (covered separately) |
| Damage by tenant/household/employee/guest |

---

### Basis of Claim Payment

> 💡 **From Transcript (330.68s-384.44s):** "The basis of claim payment here is usually actual cash value or replacement cost on building structures and actual cash value on contents. You'll have the same conditions as the homeowners forms... The basis of claim payment here is actual cash value on buildings, structures and personal property. So there's typically no replacement cost coverage on seasonal dwellings."

| Settlement Type | Applies To |
|-----------------|------------|
| **ACV or RC** | Building structures (Secondary) |
| **ACV only** | Contents (Secondary) |
| **ACV only** | Everything (Seasonal) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Seasonal dwellings = CHEAP insurance = CHEAP payouts. You usually get ACV (depreciated value), not replacement cost. Your 10-year-old couch is worth $50, not the $500 you paid.

---

### Why Vandalism is Often Excluded

> 💡 **From Transcript (401.56s-409.28s):** "Vandalism is typically excluded unless it's shown directly on the declarations page. This is because with secondary residences and seasonal dwellings, the owner isn't there all the time and so the risk of vandalism goes up."

| Vandalism Risk |
|----------------|
| Owner not there all the time |
| Risk goes up |
| Must be shown on dec page to be covered |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your cottage is empty 10 months a year. Vandals love empty houses. Insurance companies know this, so they don't cover vandalism by default. You have to specifically ask (and pay extra) for it.

---

## 🏠 Part 3: Short-Term Rental / Airbnb Coverage (7:01 - 7:33)

> 💡 **From Transcript (416.52s-452.6s):** "In recent times, the sharing economy, Airbnb, VRBO and those types of things are becoming more popular. And most homeowners insurance policies don't allow for short-term rentals by default. And so a specialized policy is usually required, especially if you have a standalone Airbnb property. So this covers you if you're renting out part or all of your primary or secondary dwelling as a short-term rental. And the short-term rentals can be facilitated by any third-party like an app or a website."

### Airbnb/VRBO Coverage

| Short-Term Rental |
|-------------------|
| Standard homeowners doesn't cover it |
| Need specialized policy |
| Covers primary or secondary dwelling |
| Facilitated by any app/website |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You list your basement on Airbnb. A guest breaks your window. Your regular home insurance says "NOPE, not covered—you're running a business." You need a special Airbnb endorsement or policy.

---

## 📜 Part 4: Endorsements (7:36 - 20:00)

> 💡 **From Transcript (452.6s-456.0s):** "So now let's talk about some endorsements."

Endorsements are **optional add-ons** you can purchase to enhance your coverage.

---

### 4a. Personal Articles Coverage (7:40 - 8:50)

> 💡 **From Transcript (456.0s-529.959s):** "The first endorsement I want to discuss is the personal articles coverage. This gives you global, all-risk coverage for high value property. So it covers things like cameras, projectors, firearms, furs, jewellery, watches, silverware, stamps, coins, and even musical instruments."

| Personal Articles Coverage |
|---------------------------|
| Global, all-risk coverage |
| High value property |
| Items: cameras, firearms, furs, jewellery, watches, silverware, stamps, coins, musical instruments |

---

#### Special Conditions

> 💡 **From Transcript (476.88s-529.959s):** "For stamps and coins, they will only pay up to $250 per article... For newly acquired articles, they are covered for $5,000 for 30 days... The third special condition is for valued coverage... If you choose valued coverage, the insurance company would pay a pre-agreed value upon the total loss of that item... There is no coverage for musical instruments that are paid for a fee... typically under the personal articles endorsement, there is no deductible."

| Condition | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Stamps/Coins | Max $250 per article |
| Newly Acquired | $5,000 for 30 days (if similar to listed items) |
| Valued Coverage | Pre-agreed value for total loss (optional) |
| Musical Instruments for Fee | No coverage (needs written permission) |
| Deductible | **None** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You have a $50,000 Rolex. Standard home insurance only pays $2,000. With Personal Articles Coverage:
> - Your Rolex is fully covered
> - **No deductible** (you pay $0 out of pocket)
> - You can agree on a specific value upfront ("valued coverage")
> - If you buy a new watch, it's covered for 30 days while you tell the insurance company

---

### 4b. Fine Arts Coverage (8:50 - 10:34)

> 💡 **From Transcript (529.96s-634.56s):** "The next endorsement I want to talk about is the fine arts coverage. Again, this gives you all risk coverage. So fine art can really be anything. There is no hard and fast definition. It can include paintings and pictures, artistic rare or historically significant property like books. It can really be anything."

| Fine Arts Coverage |
|-------------------|
| All-risk coverage |
| No strict definition |
| Includes: paintings, pictures, rare books, historically significant items |

---

#### Locations Covered

> 💡 **From Transcript (549.08s-570.64s):** "The locations covered under this fine arts endorsement are specified locations and also while it's in transit between specified locations. There are also at any other location in Canada or the continental U.S., limited to 10% of whatever limiting purchased, excluding wilds at a fair ground or an exposition."

| Location | Coverage |
|----------|----------|
| Specified locations | Full |
| In transit | Full |
| Other locations (Canada/US) | 10% of limit |
| Fairground/Exposition | ❌ Excluded |

---

#### Fine Arts Exclusions

> 💡 **From Transcript (570.64s-611.12s):** "Wear and tear, deterioration, defect, mechanical breakdown, rust corrosion, mould, condensation, contamination, or extreme's in temperature are not covered. The case is not covered... Any damage caused by birds, vermin or insects or loss while being worked on if it was caused by that work is also not covered. So if you have a painting that's in for repairs, somebody is repairing or restoring the artwork and they break it, there is no coverage under this fine arts endorsement."

| Fine Arts Excludes |
|-------------------|
| Wear and tear, deterioration |
| Mechanical breakdown, rust, mould |
| Temperature extremes |
| Breakage (unless add breakage endorsement) |
| Birds, vermin, insects |
| Damage while being repaired |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Painting Repair

| Scenario | Covered? |
|----------|----------|
| Painting is being restored | |
| Restorer breaks it | ❌ No |

---

#### Newly Acquired & Packing Rules

> 💡 **From Transcript (611.2s-623.84s):** "Newly acquired items are covered for 30 days for 25% of the insured limits and any packing or unpacking of fine art must be done by competent packers."

| Rule | Details |
|------|---------|
| Newly Acquired | 30 days, 25% of limit |
| Packing | Must be done by COMPETENT packers |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You bought a $100,000 painting. It's covered for $25,000 for 30 days while you add it to your policy. DON'T pack it yourself—hire professionals or you might void coverage!

---

#### Fine Arts Breakage Coverage

> 💡 **From Transcript (623.84s-634.56s):** "And finally we have the fine arts breakage coverage which deletes exclusion to, as we've discussed previously."

| Fine Arts Breakage |
|-------------------|
| Adds back breakage coverage |
| Deletes the breakage exclusion |

### 4c. Earthquake Endorsement (10:34 - 11:50)

> 💡 **From Transcript (634.56s-710.36s):** "Earthquake is also a very popular endorsement to apply to home insurance policies, because earthquakes have the potential for being such a catastrophic and devastating loss. The deductibles are usually pretty high."

| Earthquake Endorsement |
|-----------------------|
| Very popular |
| Catastrophic potential |
| HIGH deductibles |

---

#### High Deductibles

> 💡 **From Transcript (647.6s-663.88s):** "So it's usually a really high dollar figure or a percentage of the insured values. Sometimes it would be a percentage of the insured values or percentage of loss with a minimum of something like $100,000. So the deductibles are very, very high on earthquake."

| Earthquake Deductibles |
|-----------------------|
| High dollar figure |
| OR % of insured value |
| OR % of loss with minimum (e.g., $100,000) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Earthquake insurance is EXPENSIVE. The deductible might be $100,000! You pay the first $100K, insurance pays the rest. Still worth it in BC where big quakes happen.

---

#### 7-Day Aftershock Rule

> 💡 **From Transcript (663.88s-689.0s):** "Also special to earthquake insurance is that any aftershocks or shocks that occur within seven days is considered one shock and therefore one occurrence. So if you had one major earthquake and two aftershocks, it would not be considered three separate events with three separate limits and three separate deductibles required to be paid. It would just be considered one event with one limit and one deductible."

### 📋 Transcript Example: 1 Quake + 2 Aftershocks

| Scenario | How It's Treated |
|----------|------------------|
| 1 major earthquake | |
| + 2 aftershocks (within 7 days) | |
| = **1 event, 1 deductible** | ✅ |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> A big earthquake hits. Three days later, an aftershock. A week later, another. ALL THREE = ONE EVENT. You only pay ONE deductible, not three.

---

#### Earthquake for Condos

> 💡 **From Transcript (696.08s-710.36s):** "Earthquake is also applicable to condos for all risk, which comes with coverage for personal property, additional living expenses, unit improvements, loss assessments, and additional unit protection. So it doesn't only just apply to home insurance."

| Condo Earthquake |
|-----------------|
| Personal property |
| Additional living expenses |
| Unit improvements |
| Loss assessments |
| Additional unit protection |

---

### 🧠 Deep Explanation: Earthquake for Condos

#### 🤔 First, Understand How Condo Insurance Works

When you own a **condo**, you actually have **TWO layers of insurance**:

| Layer | Who Buys It | What It Covers |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **1. Master Policy** | Condo corporation (building management) | Common areas (hallways, lobby, roof, elevators, parking garage) |
| **2. Your Personal Condo Policy** | YOU (the unit owner) | Your unit + your stuff + your upgrades |

**The Problem:** The condo corporation's master policy covers the **building's structure**, but NOT:
- Your personal furniture/electronics
- Your fancy kitchen renovation
- The hardwood floors you installed
- Your hotel costs if you have to move out temporarily

---

#### 🌍 What Happens During an Earthquake?

Imagine a big earthquake hits your condo building in Ottawa:

##### Scenario 1: Damage to Common Areas

The earthquake cracks the building's lobby, destroys the elevator, and damages the roof.

| Who Pays? | Answer |
|-----------|--------|
| Condo corporation's master policy | ✅ Should cover this |
| BUT... | Master policy deductible is $500,000! |
| Condo corp says: | "All 100 unit owners, pay $5,000 each to cover the deductible" |
| This is called: | **Loss Assessment** |

##### Scenario 2: Damage to YOUR Unit

The earthquake cracks your walls, destroys your TV, and makes your unit unlivable for 3 months.

| What's Damaged? | Who Pays? |
|-----------------|-----------|
| Your furniture/electronics | YOUR condo insurance |
| Your upgrade (granite countertops) | YOUR condo insurance |
| Hotel for 3 months | YOUR condo insurance (Additional Living Expenses) |

---

#### 📋 Breaking Down the 5 Condo Earthquake Coverages

| # | Coverage | What It Means | Real Example |
|---|----------|---------------|--------------|
| 1 | **Personal Property** | Your stuff inside the unit | TV, furniture, laptop, clothes destroyed by earthquake |
| 2 | **Additional Living Expenses (ALE)** | Your temporary housing costs | Unit is unlivable → hotel + meals for 3 months |
| 3 | **Unit Improvements** | Upgrades YOU made to the unit | Hardwood floors, new kitchen cabinets, granite counters you installed |
| 4 | **Loss Assessments** | Your share of building-wide damage | Condo corp charges you $5,000 to help cover lobby repairs |
| 5 | **Additional Unit Protection** | Extra structural coverage for your unit | Your unit's walls/ceiling that aren't covered by master policy |

---

#### 🏗️ Unit Improvements - Why This Matters

When the condo was built, it had **basic finishes** (called the "standard unit"):
- Basic carpet
- Standard cabinets
- Basic countertops
- Builder-grade appliances

**The condo corp's master policy only covers THIS basic version.**

But YOU added:
- Hardwood floors ($10,000)
- Custom kitchen ($25,000)
- Marble bathroom ($8,000)

**If earthquake destroys these → Master policy pays $0. YOUR condo policy pays (if you have this endorsement).**

---

#### 💰 Loss Assessments - Why This Matters

This is the tricky one. Here's how it works:

1. Earthquake damages the building's common areas
2. Condo corp files claim on master policy
3. Master policy says: "Deductible is $200,000"
4. Condo corp doesn't have $200K in reserve
5. Condo corp sends YOU a bill: "Pay your share = $2,000"
6. **Loss Assessment coverage** in YOUR policy pays this bill for you!

##### 📋 Loss Assessment Example

| Building | Details |
|----------|---------|
| 100 units in building | |
| Master policy deductible | $200,000 |
| Each unit's share | $2,000 |
| Your Loss Assessment coverage | Pays your $2,000 share |

---

#### 🎯 Why This Section Exists

The transcript is saying: **"Earthquake insurance isn't just for houses—it works for condos too!"**

But for condos, it covers **different things** because condos have a unique split between:
- What the building (corp) insures
- What YOU insure

---

#### ⚠️ Key Points for RIBO Exam

1. **Condos have 2 layers of insurance** (Master + Personal)
2. **Unit Improvements** = YOUR upgrades NOT covered by master policy
3. **Loss Assessments** = YOUR share when building makes a claim
4. **All 5 coverages** work together to protect condo owners from earthquake damage
5. **Deductibles are still high** (5-20% of coverage or $100K minimum)

---

### 4d. Sewer Backup / Water Escape Coverage (11:55 - 13:28)

> 💡 **From Transcript (710.36s-734.079s):** "Another very popular endorsement is the sewer backup or water escape coverage. This covers water entering the dwelling due to an accidental escape of water from things like melting of snow and ice on the roof, a sewer, a drain, a septic tank, or a downspout. Basically sewer backup insures all kinds of waste water that has escaped and damaged your property."

| Sewer Backup Covers |
|--------------------|
| Melting snow/ice on roof |
| Sewer backup |
| Drain backup |
| Septic tank overflow |
| Downspout issues |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Sewage backs up into your basement = GROSS and EXPENSIVE. This endorsement covers it. Also covers water from melting snow on your roof, backed-up drains, and septic tank overflows.

---

#### Concurrent Causation

> 💡 **From Transcript (734.079s-765.84s):** "There's also a concept here called concurrent causation that allows coverage of multiple perils contribute to the water damage even if it's not covered by the standard policy. For example, if a sewer backup, which is a covered event, if you purchase this endorsement, occurs due to heavy rainfall, which is something that ordinarily would not be covered, it would still be covered because it's considered sewer backup under the concurrent causation clause. As in, the two things happen to concurrently, one of them is covered, therefore it will be covered."

### 📋 Transcript Example: Sewer + Heavy Rain

| Scenario | Covered? |
|----------|----------|
| Heavy rainfall (not covered) | ❌ |
| + Causes sewer backup (covered with endorsement) | |
| = **COVERED** (concurrent causation) | ✅ |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Heavy rain causes the city sewer to back up into your house. Rain isn't covered, but sewer backup IS. Since both happened together ("concurrent causation"), you're COVERED!

---

#### Bundle for Savings

> 💡 **From Transcript (765.84s-806.079s):** "Typically the sewer backup is also bundled together with extended water damage coverage, so that would cover things like groundwater, overland water, sewer backup, or water escape, or the failure of a pump. This can be more cost-effective than purchasing these policies or these endorsements, separate."

| Extended Water Bundle |
|----------------------|
| Groundwater |
| Overland water |
| Sewer backup |
| Water escape |
| Pump failure |
| **Bundling = Discount** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Ask your broker about a "water package" that bundles sewer backup, flood, and pump failure together. You'll save money compared to buying each separately.

---

### 4e. Residence Glass Breakage (13:28 - 13:49)

> 💡 **From Transcript (808.199s-829.36s):** "Another common endorsement is the residence glass breakage. This removes or reduces the deductible on damage to building glass. This is important because usually the amount of loss for glass breakage is typically lower than your deductible, so in most cases you won't actually be able to claim it without this endorsement that removes the deductible."

| Glass Breakage Endorsement |
|---------------------------|
| Removes/reduces deductible |
| Glass damage usually < deductible |
| Without it, you can't claim |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Replace a broken window = $300. Your deductible = $1,000. Without this endorsement, you pay the full $300 yourself. With this endorsement, the deductible is waived!

---

### 4f. Vacancy Permit (13:49 - 14:40)

> 💡 **From Transcript (829.36s-880.04s):** "We also have the vacancy permit. This will allow your dwellings to be vacant for more than 30 days, because if you recall under the standard home insurance policies, they don't allow your premises to be vacant for too long. If it's from more than 30 days, you need to buy a vacancy permit that will allow coverage for that."

| Vacancy Permit |
|----------------|
| Allows dwelling to be vacant >30 days |
| Required if house is empty long-term |

---

#### Vacancy Permit Coverage

> 💡 **From Transcript (846.48s-880.04s):** "It covers very basic things like fire and lightning, smoke, windstorm and hail, impact by air or landcraft that's not owned or operated by the insured, explosion, riot or falling object. So coverage here for things like water damage, vandalism, theft, those are typically excluded under the vacancy permit. It's usually quite expensive and it usually requires a fairly high deductible because they want to address the moral hazard risk of somebody burning down their own vacant premises to claim the insurance money."

| Vacancy Permit Covers |
|----------------------|
| Fire & lightning |
| Smoke |
| Windstorm & hail |
| Impact by aircraft/vehicle (not owned by insured) |
| Explosion |
| Riot |
| Falling object |

| Vacancy Permit Excludes |
|------------------------|
| ❌ Water damage |
| ❌ Vandalism |
| ❌ Theft |

| Vacancy Permit Features |
|------------------------|
| Expensive |
| High deductible |
| Addresses moral hazard (arson risk) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You inherit grandma's house and it's empty for 6 months. Standard insurance says "30 days empty = no coverage." A vacancy permit keeps you covered, BUT it's expensive, has a high deductible, and doesn't cover water/vandalism/theft.

---

### 4g. Personal Computer Coverage (14:40 - 16:17)

> 💡 **From Transcript (880.04s-977.12s):** "Next is the personal computer coverage. This gives you global, all risk coverage for listed computer equipment, media and software. It excludes business equipment because this is personal property insurance."

| Personal Computer Coverage |
|---------------------------|
| Global, all-risk |
| Equipment, media, software |
| Excludes business equipment |

---

#### Exclusions

> 💡 **From Transcript (893.84s-903.92s):** "The cost of gathering data, electronic or magnetic injury, but lightning damages okay, or lost to irreplaceable media or software."

| Computer Excludes |
|------------------|
| Cost of gathering data |
| Electronic/magnetic injury (BUT lightning OK) |
| Irreplaceable media/software |

---

#### Newly Acquired Limits

> 💡 **From Transcript (905.24s-917.64s):** "So for newly acquired articles, they are covered automatically for 30 days, but equipment only for 5,000 maximum media or software for a maximum of a thousand dollars."

| Newly Acquired | Limit |
|----------------|-------|
| Equipment | $5,000 |
| Media/Software | $1,000 |
| Time | 30 days |

---

#### Replacement Cost Condition

> 💡 **From Transcript (917.64s-949.96s):** "The basis of claims payment here is the cost to repair or replace or replace from cost if it's done in a reasonable time and the property was being used for original purpose at the time of loss. So if you had a laptop that you were actually using as a laptop at the time of loss, you would have replacement cost coverage for it if you replaced it in a reasonable amount of time. However, if you were using the laptop as a door stop, you would not be able to get replacement costs, you would only get actual cash value."

### 📋 Transcript Example: Laptop as Laptop vs Doorstop

| Scenario | Payment |
|----------|---------|
| Laptop used as laptop | Replacement cost |
| Laptop used as doorstop | ACV only |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your gaming laptop gets fried by a power surge. If you were actually USING it for gaming = Replacement Cost (brand new laptop). If it was propping open a door = ACV (whatever your old laptop is worth used).

---

#### Definitions

> 💡 **From Transcript (952.04s-977.12s):** "Equipment means things like the CPU, monitor, keyboard, printer and other sort of accessory devices. Media means the storage device for data so hard drives, CDs, DVDs, things like that. And software means programs that are stored on the media."

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Equipment** | CPU, monitor, keyboard, printer, accessories |
| **Media** | Hard drives, CDs, DVDs (storage devices) |
| **Software** | Programs stored on media |

---

### 4h. Watercraft Coverage (16:17 - 17:15)

> 💡 **From Transcript (977.12s-1034.96s):** "The next coverage you get is for watercraft, outboard motor, trailer and miscellaneous equipment coverage. This coverage is provided to you on an all risk basis. It basically covers the boat itself and also any permanently attached equipment, motors, the boat trailer and other equipment. It'll only give you coverage in Canada and in the continental US only. And you must buy a limit equal to 100% of the insured property. And there's a hundred dollars deductible typically. However, the deductible would be waived on a total loss."

| Watercraft Coverage |
|--------------------|
| All-risk |
| Boat + attached equipment + motor + trailer |
| Canada & continental US only |
| Limit = 100% of property value |
| Deductible: $100 (waived on total loss) |

---

#### Exclusions

> 💡 **From Transcript (1011.72s-1025.4s):** "It excludes damaged caused by a transportation. So if you're towing it on the boat trailer, you get into a car crash. There's no coverage here under this endorsement and also collision with an underwater or floating object."

| Watercraft Excludes |
|--------------------|
| Damage during transportation (towing) |
| Collision with underwater/floating object |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Towing Car Crash

| Scenario | Covered? |
|----------|----------|
| Towing boat, car crash | ❌ No |
| Hit underwater rock | ❌ No |

---

#### Newly Acquired

> 💡 **From Transcript (1025.4s-1034.96s):** "And a newly acquired equipment is covered for 30 days for a maximum of $5,000."

| Newly Acquired | Limit |
|----------------|-------|
| 30 days | $5,000 |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your boat, motor, and trailer are covered. BUT if you're towing the boat and get in a car crash, this endorsement doesn't cover it (your auto insurance might). Also, hitting a rock underwater isn't covered.

---

### 4i. Freezer Food (17:15 - 17:33)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1034.96s-1052.96s):** "The next endorsement is freezer food. Basically it gives you the same coverage for freezer food as you would under homeowners, but it extends it to seasonal or secondary dwellings. So if you have a regular homeowners insurance, you don't actually need this. This is really only for seasonal or secondary dwellings."

| Freezer Food Endorsement |
|-------------------------|
| Same coverage as homeowners |
| For seasonal/secondary dwellings only |
| Not needed for primary home |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your cottage freezer is full of meat. Power goes out, meat spoils. This endorsement covers it (standard cottage insurance doesn't).

---

### 4j. Mass Evacuation (17:33 - 17:42)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1052.96s-1061.96s):** "The next endorsement is for mass evacuation. It gives you the same coverage as before, but it removes the two week limit."

| Mass Evacuation Endorsement |
|---------------------------|
| Removes 2-week limit on civil authority coverage |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> A wildfire forces you to evacuate for 3 months. Standard coverage only pays 2 weeks of living expenses. This endorsement removes that limit—you're covered the whole time.

---

### 4k. Home Business Extension (17:42 - 18:51)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1061.96s-1130.92s):** "Next is the home business extension. So there's really no standard to this. A lot of insurance companies have their own variations. It really depends on the business that you operate and the types of coverage that you need."

| Home Business Extension |
|------------------------|
| No standard—varies by insurer |
| Depends on your business type |

---

#### Coverage Added

> 💡 **From Transcript (1074.12s-1116.6s):** "So typically it would remove the exclusion for business use and add on coverage for on and off premises, business property, liability such as products or completed operations liability, personal injury liability, advertising liability. For example, if you defame a competitor in an advertisement... Electronic equipment for business, data for business, account receivables coverage, credit card coverage for businesses, and they might also increase the special limits on money if you keep some cash at home. If you bought a personal umbrella liability policy, it would also extend to your home business if you have this extension."

| Home Business Adds |
|-------------------|
| ✅ Removes business use exclusion |
| ✅ On/off premises business property |
| ✅ Products/completed operations liability |
| ✅ Personal injury liability |
| ✅ Advertising liability |
| ✅ Business interruption & extra expenses |
| ✅ Business electronic equipment |
| ✅ Business data |
| ✅ Accounts receivable |
| ✅ Credit card coverage |
| ✅ Increased money limits |
| ✅ Extends personal umbrella to business |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Defaming Competitor

| Scenario | Coverage |
|----------|----------|
| You defame a competitor in an ad | Advertising liability |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You run an Etsy store from home. Standard home insurance says "Business? Not covered." This extension:
> - Covers your inventory
> - Covers if a customer sues you
> - Covers if you accidentally defame a competitor online
> - Covers if someone steals your business cash

---

#### Underwriting Factors

> 💡 **From Transcript (1116.6s-1130.92s):** "Underwriting for this extension depends on the business that you operate, the property values that you're keeping at home, annual sales, and also alarms or other security systems you might have."

| Underwriting Factors |
|---------------------|
| Type of business |
| Property values at home |
| Annual sales |
| Alarms/security systems |

---

### 4l. Additional Conditions (18:51 - 20:00)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1130.92s-1199.56s):** "There are also some additional conditions."

---

#### Notify Authority

> 💡 **From Transcript (1133.88s-1141.76s):** "So you have to notify authority. So call the police. If a loss was caused by a criminal act..."

| Condition | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Notify Authority** | Call police if criminal act |

---

#### No Benefit to Bailee

> 💡 **From Transcript (1141.76s-1165.84s):** "No benefit to bailee, meaning you cannot release a belly of liability. But say for example, I'm a dry cleaner, so I'm a bailee. You give me your clothes to dry clean and I damage them. But because we're good friends, you say, hey, Jack, don't worry about it. I'm just going to claim me with my insurance company. You don't have to pay me. You cannot do that. If the insurance company pays you for that coat, they can still come back and subrogate against me."

### 📋 Transcript Example: Dry Cleaner Friend

| Scenario |
|----------|
| You give coat to dry cleaner friend |
| Friend damages it |
| You claim with YOUR insurance |
| You tell friend "Don't worry, I won't sue you" |
| **Insurance company CAN STILL sue your friend** (subrogation) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You can't let your friend off the hook. If the dry cleaner ruins your coat and insurance pays you, the insurance company has the right to go after the dry cleaner to get their money back.

---

#### Sue and Labour

> 💡 **From Transcript (1171.4s-1188.04s):** "Sue and labour, meaning the insured must take reasonable steps to recover a loss property. The insurance company will pay pro-rata for those related expenses. That means, for example, if you've crashed your car, you cannot just leave it on the side of the road. You must get it towed to a safe location."

### 📋 Transcript Example: Crashed Car

| Scenario | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| Car crashes | Can't leave it on road |
| Must tow to safe location | Insurance pays pro-rata |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your car is totaled on the highway. You can't just walk away. You MUST get it towed somewhere safe, and insurance helps pay for the tow.

---

#### Pair and Set or Parts

> 💡 **From Transcript (1165.84s-1171.4s):** "Next is for pair and set or parts. It works exactly the same as what we've discussed previously."

| Pair & Set |
|-----------|
| Same as homeowners |
| Part of a set damaged = pays proportionally |

---

#### Basis of Settlement

> 💡 **From Transcript (1188.04s-1193.2s):** "Also basis of settlement is actual cash value, unless stated otherwise."

| Default Settlement |
|-------------------|
| ACV (unless stated otherwise) |

---

#### Subrogation

> 💡 **From Transcript (1193.2s-1199.56s):** "And there's also the concept of subrogation, which I've touched on just now, but it will be discussed in more detail later on."

| Subrogation |
|-------------|
| Insurance company's right to recover from responsible party |
| Discussed in detail elsewhere |

---
