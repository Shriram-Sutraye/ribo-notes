This part covers the **three property classes** and the critical **co-insurance clause**.

## 🏗️ The Three Classes of Commercial Property (6:03 - 10:31)

> 💡 **From Transcript (363.98s-382.06s):** "So now let's talk about some clauses that are commonly found in most commercial property policies. The first and probably the most important one is a description of the property insured. So like we talked about earlier, there are three classes of commercial property. You have buildings, stock and equipment."

---

### Class 1: BUILDING (6:23 - 7:29)

> 💡 **From Transcript (383.42s-428.3s):** "When it comes to buildings, real definition is the building that's described on the declaration page. So there's usually going to be an address on there. And that includes, of course, the building itself, but also any fixed structures that are related to the building. So like metal fences, signs, bike stands. Also any permanent fixtures to the building, like air conditioning units, carpets, light fixtures, bathroom fixtures. Additions and extensions that are connected to the building. So walkways and canopies. Also any materials and equipment on the premises for maintenance or for normal repairs. And finally, decorative indoor clients."

| Building Includes |
|------------------|
| The building described on dec page |
| Fixed structures (fences, signs, bike stands) |
| Permanent fixtures (A/C, carpets, lights, bathroom fixtures) |
| Additions/extensions (walkways, canopies) |
| Materials for maintenance/repairs |
| Decorative indoor plants |

---

### 💡 The "Shake It Upside Down" Test

> 💡 **From Transcript (421.5s-439.58s):** "So when you think about the building, think about if you have turned it upside down and shook it, everything that stays attached is considered part of the building. So when you buy a piece of real estate, what do you actually buy? You buy the building, you buy the air conditioning units attached to it, you buy all these other things."

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (The Shake Test):**
> Imagine picking up the building and shaking it upside down. Everything that STAYS ATTACHED = part of the building. Everything that FALLS OUT = not the building (probably equipment or stock).
> 
> **Stays attached:** A/C units, carpets bolted down, bathroom sinks
> **Falls out:** Office chairs, paper, coffee machines

---

### Class 2: STOCK (7:25 - 9:15)

> 💡 **From Transcript (445.66s-508.22s):** "Next is stock. So stock is defined as any merchandise that is usual to the business. So what is normally sold by that type of business? There's no standard definition. It just depends on the type of business you operate. So if you operate it a convenience store, the definition of stock would include everything that is typically sold in a convenience store... Aside from the merchandise, it also includes any packaging or advertising material, like catalogues, boxes, grocery bags, takeaway containers because those are all parts of the things that you sell, right?"

| Stock Includes |
|----------------|
| Merchandise usual to the business |
| Packaging materials (boxes, bags) |
| Advertising materials (catalogues) |
| Property of others in insured's care (if legally liable or by contract) |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Convenience Store vs Paint Store

| Convenience Store | NOT Stock |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Chips, candy, drinks = Stock | Paint, power tools (unusual) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Stock = whatever you SELL. A bakery's stock = bread, cakes, pastries. A hardware store's stock = tools, nails, paint.
> 
> It also includes:
> - **Bags and boxes** you put the stuff in
> - **Catalogues** you hand out
> - **Other people's stuff** you're holding (like a tailor holding someone's clothes for alterations)

---

### 📋 Transcript Example: Bailee (Clothing Repairs)

> 💡 **From Transcript (491.82s-502.62s):** "For example, you're a bailee. So if you sold clothing items, but you also repaired or altered clothing items, then the clothes that people give to you to repair or alter would also be considered stock because this part of the stuff that you sell conceptually."

| Bailee Example |
|---------------|
| You sell AND repair clothes |
| Customer gives you their pants to alter |
| Those pants = YOUR stock (while in your care) |

---

### Stock Rates & Peak Season Endorsement

> 💡 **From Transcript (508.22s-551.339s):** "The rates and premiums that you pay for stock coverage will depend on the nature of the stock. If you are insuring stock that is perishable or easily damaged or highly valuable, your rates and premiums on that might be higher. Stock is typically covered for actual cash value and the stock limits can often fluctuate annually. If it does, you might get something called a peak season endorsement. What that does is it automatically adjusts the limit for months where inventory is higher or lower."

| Stock Rate Factors |
|-------------------|
| Perishable? = Higher |
| Easily damaged? = Higher |
| Highly valuable? = Higher |
| Settlement: Usually ACV |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Toy Store Peak Season

> 💡 **From Transcript (537.02s-551.339s):** "For example, if you run a toy store, you might anticipate having higher inventory in October and November, leading up to Christmas. So you would purchase what's called a peak season endorsement to allow your inventory to limit to increase during those peak times."

| Peak Season Endorsement |
|------------------------|
| Toy store |
| October/November = MORE inventory (Christmas) |
| Limit automatically increases during peak |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> A toy store barely has anything in July, but by November it's PACKED for Christmas. The peak season endorsement automatically raises your coverage limit during busy seasons so you're not underinsured.

### Class 3: EQUIPMENT (9:13 - 10:31)

> 💡 **From Transcript (553.099s-621.66s):** "And the third and final definition we'll discuss here is equipment. Similar to stock, equipment just includes any content usual to the business. So kind of furnishings, machinery, utensils, tools, etc. are typically used in your type of business. If you operate a restaurant, the types of things that would be insured would be very different than if you operated a dental office. It also includes any similar property of others."

| Equipment Includes |
|-------------------|
| Furnishings, machinery, utensils, tools |
| Property of others (similar to what you'd have) |
| Tenant improvements |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Leased Photocopier

> 💡 **From Transcript (582.86s-599.18s):** "So for example, if you have any photocopiers, forklifts, just depending on what's similar to your business. If you run in insurance office and you lease a photocopier, then that photocopier technically belongs to somebody else, but it's similar to what you would typically have in your business, therefore it would be covered under your equipment limit."

| Leased Equipment |
|-----------------|
| You run an insurance office |
| You lease a photocopier (belongs to someone else) |
| It's "similar" to your business = covered as equipment |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your restaurant's ovens, blenders, and tables = equipment. Even if you RENT a mixer, it's covered because it's normal for a restaurant to have mixers.

---

### Tenant Improvements

> 💡 **From Transcript (605.82s-616.62s):** "Also insured under equipment are any tenant improvements. So these are any improvements or renovations or modifications that are done at the expense of the tenant, meaning the tenant pays for it and stays once they leave so it's fixed."

| Tenant Improvements |
|--------------------|
| Renovations paid by tenant |
| Stays when tenant leaves (fixed) |
| Covered under equipment |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You rent a retail space and install new shelving, cabinets, or a nice counter. You paid for it. Even though you don't own the building, those improvements are YOUR equipment.

---

### Settlement Basis

> 💡 **From Transcript (616.62s-621.66s):** "All of this type of property, whether it's building stock or equipment can be covered on an actual cash value or replacement cost basis. It's up to the insured to choose."

| Settlement Options |
|-------------------|
| ACV (Actual Cash Value) |
| OR Replacement Cost |
| Insured chooses |

---

## 📊 Co-insurance Clause (10:31 - 15:10)

> 💡 **From Transcript (631.18s-652.859s):** "Another really important clause in most commercial policies is the co-insurance clause. The co-insurance clause basically states that you must purchase a minimum limit of insurance based on a percentage of the actual insured values. And this applies to each of the three types of property we just discussed separately. So you need to meet the minimum limit for the building for the equipment and for the stock separately."

### What is Co-insurance?

| Co-insurance |
|--------------|
| Must purchase minimum limit = % of actual value |
| Applies to Building, Stock, Equipment SEPARATELY |
| Penalty if you don't meet the minimum |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> The insurance company says: "You MUST buy enough coverage!" If your property is worth $1 million and they require 80% co-insurance, you MUST buy at least $800,000 coverage. If you don't, they'll penalize you when you claim.

---

### ⚠️ Waiver of Co-insurance

> 💡 **From Transcript (652.859s-681.5s):** "There's also an important concept called the waiver of co-insurance. This states that co-insurance only applies to partial losses that are greater than or equal to 2% of your amount of insurance or limit or 5,000 dollars. So if the insured experiences a total loss, which means a loss greater than the policy limit, or the loss is less than 2% of the policy limit or less than 5,000 dollars, then there is no need to apply the co-insurance formula when calculating the payout."

### When Co-insurance Does NOT Apply (Waiver)

| Co-insurance Waiver Applies If: |
|--------------------------------|
| ✅ Total loss (loss > policy limit) |
| ✅ Loss < 2% of policy limit |
| ✅ Loss < $5,000 |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> If you have a REALLY SMALL claim (under $5,000 or under 2% of your policy), they won't penalize you. If you have a TOTAL LOSS (everything's gone), they won't penalize you either—they just pay the limit.

---

### 📋 Transcript Example 1: Small Loss, Waiver DOES NOT Apply

> 💡 **From Transcript (699.1s-721.58s):** "So here's an example of a small loss, but one where the waiver still applies. So let's say you have a person named David. He's the insured. He experiences a $15,000 loss on $1 million worth of property. Since 2% of $1 million is $20,000, and the loss is less than this threshold, but it's still greater than $5,000. In that case, the co-insurance penalty still applies."

| David's Example |
|-----------------|
| Property value: $1,000,000 |
| Policy limit: $1,000,000 |
| Loss: $15,000 |
| 2% of $1M = $20,000 |
| $15,000 < $20,000 BUT > $5,000 |
| **Co-insurance APPLIES** (penalty possible) |

---

### 📋 Transcript Example 2: Total Loss, Waiver Applies

> 💡 **From Transcript (732.86s-743.42s):** "Another scenario where the waiver would apply is a total loss. Where a fired destroys the entire warehouse, resulting in a total loss of $1.2 million, since the loss exceeds the policy limit of a million dollars, co-insurance does not apply. They would simply get their million dollar payout."

| Total Loss Example |
|-------------------|
| Fire destroys warehouse |
| Actual loss: $1,200,000 |
| Policy limit: $1,000,000 |
| Loss > Limit = TOTAL LOSS |
| **Waiver applies** = pays $1M (no penalty) |

---

### The Co-insurance Formula

> 💡 **From Transcript (765.26s-781.42s):** "So the settlement formula would be the settlement is equal to the amount of insurance they did buy, divided by the amount of insurance they should have bought if they were compliant with the co-insurance requirement multiplied by their loss amount."

| Co-insurance Formula |
|---------------------|
| **Settlement = (Did Buy ÷ Should Buy) × Loss** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You bought HALF the insurance you should have? You get HALF the payout.
> 
> **Formula:** What you DID buy ÷ What you SHOULD buy × Your loss = Your payout

---

### 📋 Transcript Example 3: The $100,000 Loss

> 💡 **From Transcript (787.58s-852.7s):** "So if the insured has that $1 million worth of property, and the insured sets a co-insurance requirement of 80% the insured must purchase a limit of at least $800,000. If the insured only purchases $400,000 of insurance, a co-insurance penalty may apply to reduce the amount of settlement. So the calculation is as follows on a $100,000 loss... His settlement would be equal to the amount of insured insured did by, so $400,000 divided by the amount he should have bought, $800,000 times the $100,000 loss amount. So in the end, he would only get $50,000. The rationale here is he bought half the insurance should have bought, so he gets half the payment he should have gotten."

| Full Example |
|--------------|
| Property value: $1,000,000 |
| Co-insurance requirement: 80% |
| Should buy: $800,000 |
| Did buy: $400,000 |
| Loss: $100,000 |
| Settlement = $400K ÷ $800K × $100K = **$50,000** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> - Property = $1M
> - Must buy 80% = $800K
> - Only bought $400K (half of what's required)
> - Loss = $100K
> - **Payout = HALF of loss = $50K**
> 
> **Bought half, get half. Simple as that.**

---

### Stated Amount of Co-insurance (Alternative)

> 💡 **From Transcript (859.66s-910.62s):** "There's also a concept called the stated amount of co-insurance, which is an alternative to the classic co-insurance clause. With this, the insured files what's called a statement of values at the start of the policy and maintains and updates that statement of value spreadsheet throughout the policy term. If the limits are reduced such that they are lower than the statement of values, then the policy reverts to the original co-insurance percentage or a hundred percent co-insurance."

| Stated Amount of Co-insurance |
|------------------------------|
| File "statement of values" at start |
| Update throughout policy term |
| If limits drop below statement → reverts to 100% co-insurance |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Instead of playing the "co-insurance penalty" game, you tell the insurer exactly what everything is worth. You update it regularly. As long as you keep it accurate, you're always fully insured and never penalized.
