---

## 📋 Part 5: Section 1 - Property Coverages (5:12-5:57)

> 💡 **From Transcript (312.88s-340.32s):** "Now let's talk about losses insured and go into those two sections in a little bit more detail. So section one as mentioned before is your property coverages. You have Coverage A which insures your dwelling building, Coverage B which insures detached private structures, Coverage C for personal property and D for additional living expenses."

### Section 1: Property Coverages (A, B, C, D)

| Coverage | What It Insures |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Coverage A** | Dwelling Building (your house) |
| **Coverage B** | Detached Private Structures (garage, shed) |
| **Coverage C** | Personal Property (your stuff) |
| **Coverage D** | Additional Living Expenses (if you have to move out) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Section 1):**
> Section 1 is "YOUR STUFF":
> - **A = Your House** (the main building you live in)
> - **B = Outbuildings** (detached garage, pool house, shed)
> - **C = Your Belongings** (furniture, clothes, electronics)
> - **D = Living Expenses** (hotel, food if your house is damaged and you can't live there)

---

## 🛡️ Part 6: Section 2 - Liability Coverages (5:37-6:03)

> 💡 **From Transcript (340.32s-363.08s):** "So all homeowners or personal property forms will come with this section. It protects third parties. So you have Coverage E for personal liability, F for voluntary medical payments with no deductible, G voluntary payment for property damage, again no deductible, and Coverage H voluntary compensation for resident employees. And again there is no deductible for this coverage."

### Section 2: Liability Coverages (E, F, G, H)

| Coverage | What It Covers | Deductible? |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Coverage E** | Personal Liability (if you're sued) | Yes |
| **Coverage F** | Voluntary Medical Payments (third party injuries) | ❌ No |
| **Coverage G** | Voluntary Property Damage (third party property) | ❌ No |
| **Coverage H** | Voluntary Compensation for Resident Employees | ❌ No |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Section 2):**
> Section 2 is "YOUR MISTAKES":
> - **E = Lawsuits** (If someone sues you because they got hurt on your property)
> - **F = Medical Bills** (If a guest gets hurt, you can pay their medical bills voluntarily)
> - **G = Property Damage** (If you accidentally break your neighbor's fence)
> - **H = Employee Injuries** (If your nanny or housekeeper gets hurt on the job)
> 
> **Note:** F, G, H have NO deductible. You pay nothing out of pocket!

## 🎁 Part 7: Extensions of Coverage (6:03-9:16)

> 💡 **From Transcript (363.08s-367.96s):** "Now let's talk about some extensions of coverage that come for free with all of your homeowners forms."

These are **FREE add-ons** that come with every homeowners policy!

---

### 7a. Moving to Another Home (30 Days)

> 💡 **From Transcript (367.96s-375.4s):** "If you're moving to another home in Canada, it'll cover the new place and your property while in transit for up to 30 days."

| Moving Coverage |
|-----------------|
| New home covered |
| Property in transit covered |
| Up to **30 days** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You're moving across town. For 30 days, BOTH your old house and new house are covered. Your stuff in the moving truck is covered too!

---

### 7b. Debris Removal (5% of Coverage A)

> 💡 **From Transcript (375.4s-386.2s):** "For debris removal, it'll give you an additional 5% of your Coverage A limit to remove debris that's leftover after an insured loss or that was blown on by windstorm."

| Debris Removal |
|----------------|
| 5% of Coverage A limit |
| Removes debris after insured loss |
| Removes debris blown in by windstorm |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> A tree falls on your house. Insurance pays to fix the roof AND pays extra to haul away the tree debris. Same if a windstorm dumps garbage on your lawn.

---

### 7c. Property Removal (30 Days)

> 💡 **From Transcript (386.2s-393.96s):** "Next is property removal. This expands the removal clause we discussed in the insurance act from seven days now to 30 days."

| Property Removal |
|------------------|
| Expanded from 7 days to **30 days** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> If you move your stuff out of your house to protect it (like during a flood warning), it's covered for 30 days wherever you store it.

---

### 7d. Credit/Debit Card Forgery & Counterfeit Money ($2,000)

> 💡 **From Transcript (393.96s-401.0s):** "With credit and debit card forgery and counterfeit money, you have up to $2,000."

| Coverage | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| Credit/Debit Card Forgery | $2,000 |
| Counterfeit Money | $2,000 |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Someone steals your credit card and goes shopping? Home insurance can pay up to $2,000. You accidentally receive fake money? Also covered up to $2,000.

---

### 7e. Inflation Protection

> 💡 **From Transcript (401.0s-406.6s):** "And you also get inflation protection. So your limits will be automatically adjusted by inflation for midterm losses."

| Inflation Protection |
|---------------------|
| Limits automatically increase with inflation |
| Applies to midterm losses |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You bought the policy 6 months ago when lumber cost $100. Now lumber costs $120. Your coverage limit automatically goes up so you're not underinsured!

---

### 7f. Tear Out Clause (Water Pipe Repair)

> 💡 **From Transcript (406.6s-421.96s):** "The tear out clause is an interesting one. It'll pay to repair walls and other stuff that are torn out in order to get to a broken water pipe behind it. However it excludes the tearing out of swimming pools or fixing public water mains."

| Tear Out Clause |
|-----------------|
| Pays to open walls to access broken pipes |
| Excludes swimming pools |
| Excludes public water mains |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> A pipe bursts inside your wall. The plumber has to cut a hole in the wall to fix it. Insurance pays for BOTH the pipe AND fixing the wall. But if it's your swimming pool or the city's water main, you're on your own.

---

### 7g. Change in Temperature (Indirect Damage)

> 💡 **From Transcript (423.56s-436.44s):** "Another common extension of coverage is the change in temperature clause. This provides coverage for indirect damage to personal property inside the dwelling if the dwelling or equipment was damaged by an insured peril."

| Change in Temperature |
|----------------------|
| Covers indirect damage to personal property |
| Must be caused by an insured peril |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Lightning hits your house and fries the furnace. It's winter, and your pipes freeze and burst because there's no heat. This clause covers the frozen pipe damage because the original cause (lightning) was an insured peril.

---

### 7h. Freezer Food ($2,000)

> 💡 **From Transcript (437.56s-471.88s):** "Related to that is freezer food. So that covers spoilage due to outside power failure or freezer breakdown to $2,000. The freezer can be replaced if it's ruined by the food. So the food inside has gone so bad that the entire freezer needs to be replaced because it cannot be cleaned or there's some other issue with it. The freezer will be replaced with a zero dollar deductible. So no deductible applies to those types of losses. It excludes losses due to the operation of a circuit breaker or fuse, any interrupted or planned power outages, or simply if the freezer was unplugged accidentally."

| Freezer Food |
|--------------|
| Limit: $2,000 |
| Covers spoilage from power failure or breakdown |
| Freezer replaced if ruined by food (**$0 deductible**) |

**Excludes:**
- Circuit breaker/fuse operation
- Planned power outages
- Accidentally unplugged freezer

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Power goes out for 3 days and all your frozen meat goes bad? Covered up to $2,000. The rotten food made your freezer smell so bad you need a new one? Covered with NO deductible. But if YOU accidentally unplugged it or the city warned you about a planned outage, you're not covered.

---

### 7i. Lock Replacement ($500)

> 💡 **From Transcript (473.08s-485.0s):** "Another common one is lock replacement. This gives you up to $500 if your keys are stolen as long as you report it to the police. Again because the coverage limit is so low here, no deductible applies."

| Lock Replacement |
|------------------|
| Limit: $500 |
| Keys must be stolen |
| Must report to police |
| **No deductible** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Someone steals your keys and now you're worried they'll break in. Insurance pays up to $500 to change all your locks. But you HAVE to file a police report first!

---

### 7j. Fire Department Charges ($1,000)

> 💡 **From Transcript (487.08s-512.36s):** "Another common extension of coverage you might see on a home insurance policy is fire department charges. This will give you up to $1,000 to pay a fire department if they send you a bill. Oftentimes if you are on the border between two cities, the fire department from another city might respond. In that case because you don't pay property taxes in that city, they might send you a bill for it and the insurance company will pay up to $1,000 to cover that."

| Fire Department Charges |
|------------------------|
| Limit: $1,000 |
| Covers bills from out-of-area fire departments |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Border City Fire Response

| Scenario |
|----------|
| You live near city border |
| Neighboring city's fire dept responds |
| They send you a bill (you don't pay taxes there) |
| Insurance pays up to $1,000 |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You live at the edge of Toronto, but Mississauga's fire truck shows up first. Since you don't pay Mississauga property taxes, they send you a bill. Insurance covers it up to $1,000.

---

### 7k. Arson/Burglary Conviction Award ($1,000)

> 💡 **From Transcript (513.72s-529.48s):** "Related to that is the arson and burglary conviction award. The insurance company will pay up to $1,000 in awards to somebody who provides information leading to the conviction of an arson or burglary. There's again no deductible that applies here."

| Arson/Burglary Award |
|---------------------|
| Limit: $1,000 |
| Rewards tips leading to conviction |
| **No deductible** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your neighbor sees the person who set your house on fire. They tell the police, and the arsonist is convicted. Your insurance company pays your neighbor up to $1,000 as a "thank you" reward.

---

### 7l. Damage to Dwelling for Tenants ($500)

> 💡 **From Transcript (530.2s-578.28s):** "And finally is damage to the dwelling for tenants. This will give you up to $500 of the Coverage C limit which can be used to pay for damage to the dwelling due to theft or attempted theft, vandalism or malicious acts to the interior of the dwelling, as well as any impact by vehicle driven by the insured."

| Damage to Dwelling for Tenants |
|-------------------------------|
| Limit: $500 (from Coverage C) |
| Covers damage from: |
| - Theft/attempted theft |
| - Vandalism/malicious acts to interior |
| - Vehicle impact by insured |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You're a renter. Someone breaks in and damages the landlord's door. Normally, you'd have to pay the landlord out of pocket. But this coverage gives you up to $500 to cover that damage. Same if you accidentally drive your car into the garage door!

---

## 💰 Part 8: Basis of Claim Payment (9:16-11:16)

> 💡 **From Transcript (555.64s-578.28s):** "The basis of claim payment here would typically be the damage to the building if there is any, plus the damage to personal property if there is any, minus your deductible. Your deductible is applied once to the total amount of loss. So it's not the building damage minus deductible and then property damage minus deductible. It's only applied one time which is beneficial to the insured."

### Claim Payment Formula:

| Formula |
|---------|
| Building Damage + Property Damage - Deductible = Payout |
| Deductible applied **ONCE** to total loss |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your house has $10,000 damage and your stuff has $5,000 damage. Total loss = $15,000. With a $1,000 deductible, you get $14,000. You do NOT pay $1,000 twice!

---

### Dwelling & Structures: Replacement Cost vs ACV

> 💡 **From Transcript (579.16s-602.6s):** "Dwellings and detached private structures are insured on a replacement cost basis or if you elect not to repair them then you get actual cash value. If you do opt to repair them, it must be repaired with materials of similar quality at the same location and for the same occupancy and it has to happen within a reasonable time."

| Basis of Settlement | Condition |
|---------------------|-----------|
| **Replacement Cost** | If you repair/rebuild |
| **Actual Cash Value** | If you choose NOT to repair |

**Repair Requirements:**
- Materials of similar quality
- Same location
- Same occupancy
- Reasonable time

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> If your house burns down and you REBUILD, you get full replacement cost (brand new). If you say "forget it, I'm moving to a condo," you only get ACV (depreciated value).

---

### The 80% Co-Insurance Rule

> 💡 **From Transcript (602.6s-620.04s):** "The limit must be greater than at least 80% of the replacement cost otherwise payment is proportional so like co-insurance. If the limit you've purchased is 40% of the replacement cost then the payment is 50% of the loss because 40 divided by 80 is 50, so it operates just like co-insurance."

| 80% Rule |
|----------|
| Limit must be ≥ 80% of replacement cost |
| If not, payment is proportional (co-insurance penalty) |

### 📋 Transcript Example: 40% Limit

| Scenario | Calculation |
|----------|-------------|
| Replacement Cost: $500,000 | |
| You purchased: $200,000 (40%) | |
| Required: $400,000 (80%) | |
| You have 40/80 = 50% | |
| Loss: $100,000 | |
| **Payout: $50,000** (only 50% of loss) | |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your house is worth $500K but you only bought $200K coverage. That's only 40%, but you NEED 80%. So 40/80 = 50%. If you have a $100K claim, you only get $50K. **ALWAYS buy at least 80% coverage!**

---

### Guaranteed Replacement Cost

> 💡 **From Transcript (620.04s-655.479s):** "There's also an option to get guaranteed replacement cost coverage which covers you for the full cost to repair even if it's greater than the limit you've purchased. The conditions are that the initial dwelling limit must be equal to 100% replacement cost and you cannot reduce that limit midterm."

| Guaranteed RC |
|---------------|
| Pays full repair cost even if over limit |
| Must start at 100% replacement cost |
| Cannot reduce limit midterm |
| Must notify insurer of additions >$10,000 within 90 days |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> The ultimate upgrade. Even if construction costs go crazy and rebuilding costs MORE than your limit, insurance still pays. But you have to buy 100% coverage from the start, and if you add a $15,000 deck, you have 90 days to tell them!

---

### Bylaw Costs

> 💡 **From Transcript (661.56s-691.96s):** "Typically any cost of bylaws are excluded so when you're rebuilding a structure there could be times especially for older buildings where there are some additional things you need to bring it up to code, for example wheelchair ramps, additional sprinklers, perhaps that kind of thing. So those additional costs above and beyond what was originally in the building would not be covered. If you want coverage for that you would typically buy what's called a bylaw endorsement."

| Bylaw Costs |
|-------------|
| Excluded by default |
| Examples: wheelchair ramps, sprinklers, new codes |
| Need **Bylaw Endorsement** for coverage |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your old house didn't need sprinklers when it was built in 1960. But NOW the city requires sprinklers. If you rebuild, you have to add them, but insurance WON'T pay unless you bought a "bylaw endorsement." Recommend this to clients with older homes!
