# Other Clauses, Property Away & Mechanical Breakdown

> **Timestamp:** 15:11 - 23:01 (910s - 1381s)

## 📜 Subrogation Clause (15:11 - 16:24)

> 💡 **From Transcript (911s):** Insurance company can sue responsible party to recover claims paid.

| Subrogation |
|-------------|
| Insurer can sue responsible party |
| Will NOT sue fellow insureds |

### 📋 Example: You vs Guest Burns House

| Scenario | Subrogation? |
|----------|-------------|
| YOU burn down your house | ❌ No |
| GUEST burns it down | ✅ Yes (sue guest) |

> [!TIP] **Plain Dumb Down:** You accidentally start fire = insurance pays, won't sue you. Friend starts fire = insurance pays you, then sues friend.

### Cannot Release Liability
> You can't tell your friend "I won't sue you." Insurance company WILL still sue them.

---

## 📜 Reinstatement Clause (16:21)

> Limit is restored after claim. $100K limit → $5K loss → still $100K (not $95K).

---

## 📜 Debris Removal (16:43)

> Leftover limit after rebuild pays for debris removal.

---

## 📜 Protection Systems (16:54 - 17:42)

| Protection Systems |
|-------------------|
| Alarms, sprinklers = premium discounts |
| Must notify insurer of defects/cancellations |

### Breach Consequences
1. Reduce coverage (no theft until fixed)
2. Charge more premium
3. Cancel policy (if intentional)

> [!TIP] **Example:** Jewellery stores & banks REQUIRE protection to be insurable.
