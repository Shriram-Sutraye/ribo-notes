## 🏢 Types of Commercial Entities (21:48 - 23:19)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1308.76s-1325.479s):** "When it comes to commercial insurance, there's many different types of entities that can be considered insured. Of course, individuals or sole proprietors can be considered and insured. A sole proprietor meaning an unincorporated individual business owner. The second type of entity is a partnership, whether that's a general partnership or a limited partnership, can be considered and insured under commercial policies as well."

| 3 Types of Commercial Entities |
|-------------------------------|
| 1. Sole Proprietor |
| 2. Partnership |
| 3. Corporation |

---

## 👤 1. Sole Proprietor (21:48 - 22:05)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1319.399s-1325.479s):** "A sole proprietor meaning an unincorporated individual business owner."

| Sole Proprietor |
|----------------|
| = Individual business owner |
| Unincorporated |
| No separation between person and business |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You're a freelance graphic designer working from home. You ARE the business. There's no separate company—just you. If someone sues your business, they sue YOU personally. Your personal assets (house, car) are at risk!

---

## 🤝 2. Partnership (22:05 - 22:37)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1325.479s-1362.6s):** "The second type of entity is a partnership, whether that's a general partnership or a limited partnership, can be considered and insured under commercial policies as well. A general partnership is like a sole proprietorship, except there's more than one person involved. Under a general partnership, you can be responsible for the liabilities of other partners. Otherwise, you can choose what's called a limited partnership or a limited liability partnership depending on your jurisdiction. The way it works is the same as a general partnership, except your exposure is now limited to the amount you've invested."

### General Partnership

| General Partnership |
|--------------------|
| Like sole proprietorship but 2+ people |
| Each partner responsible for OTHER partners' liabilities |
| Full personal liability |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You and your friend start a landscaping company together. Your friend crashes the truck and causes $1 million in damages. You're BOTH on the hook—even though YOU didn't crash the truck!

---

### Limited Partnership (LP/LLP)

| Limited Partnership |
|--------------------|
| Same as general partnership BUT |
| Liability LIMITED to amount invested |
| Like a corporation's protection |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You invest $50,000 into a partnership. If the business gets sued for $1 million, the MOST you can lose is your $50,000 investment. Your house, car, personal savings are PROTECTED.

---

## 🏛️ 3. Corporation (22:49 - 23:19)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1362.6s-1405.4s):** "And third is a corporation. A corporation is an entity that is registered with the government and the owners are the shareholders of the corporation. In this case, your liability is limited to the assets of the corporation. So say for example, if you have a corporation and you want to start a cafe, you put in a hundred thousand dollars to buy a cafe and you start operating. If somebody slips and falls and you don't have insurance and let's say you get sued, the maximum liability you can lose is whatever the value you have in the corporation. So they sue the corporation, they take all the money out of it in terms of damages, and you can just shut down the corporation and you personally, your personal assets are protected from liability."

| Corporation |
|------------|
| Registered with government |
| Owners = shareholders |
| Liability LIMITED to corporation's assets |
| Personal assets PROTECTED |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Slip and Fall at Cafe

| Scenario |
|----------|
| You invest $100,000 to start a cafe (through corporation) |
| Someone slips and falls, sues for $1 million |
| No insurance |
| Corporation is sued |
| They take all $100,000 from corporation |
| You shut down the corporation |
| **Your personal assets (house, car) are SAFE!** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> A corporation is like a SHIELD between you and the business. You put money IN the shield. If the business gets sued, they can only take what's inside the shield. They can't touch YOUR personal stuff!
> 
> That's why most business owners incorporate—to protect their personal assets.

## 📄 Subscription Policies (23:31 - 26:13)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1406.28s-1423.159s):** "Another common type of commercial policy is a subscription policy. A subscription policy is one where a group of insurers decide to get together and agree to ensure a risk. Subscription policies are typically used when the risk is too big for one insurer to take on on their own."

| Subscription Policy |
|--------------------|
| Multiple insurers share ONE risk |
| Used for BIG risks |
| Too large for one company |

---

### Why Use Subscription Policies? (23:44 - 24:42)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1424.2s-1481.48s):** "This could be the case when the line of business that they're proposing to ensure is not covered by a reinsurance treaty. That means they're not able to purchase an insurance policy on their insurance policy and therefore it's too big of a risk for them to take by themselves. And therefore they choose to subscribe to only a certain percentage of the risk. They might also do it if they want to protect the reinsurer from risk, meaning they don't want to expose their reinsurance cut markets, meaning they don't want to expose their reinsurers to the risk that they're taking on here. The third reason is similar to what we've already discussed. It's where the limit of each claim is too big to absorb in one loss. Let's say for example you are ensuring $100 million dollars skyscraper. One insurance company may not want to take $100 million dollar risk all on their own if an earthquake or fire causes the whole thing to collapse."

| 4 Reasons for Subscription |
|---------------------------|
| 1. No reinsurance treaty covers this risk |
| 2. Protect reinsurer from risk exposure |
| 3. Limit of each claim too big |
| 4. Spread good risk among markets |

### 📋 Transcript Example: $100 Million Skyscraper

| Scenario |
|----------|
| $100 million skyscraper needs insurance |
| If earthquake destroys it = $100M claim |
| ONE insurer doesn't want to pay $100M |
| 5 insurers each take 20% |
| If disaster = each pays $20M |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> A $100 million building is too risky for one company. What if it burns down? They'd owe $100 million! So 5 companies share:
> - Company A: 20% (pays up to $20M)
> - Company B: 20% (pays up to $20M)
> - Company C: 20% (pays up to $20M)
> - Company D: 20% (pays up to $20M)
> - Company E: 20% (pays up to $20M)
> 
> Now no single company is wiped out by one disaster!

### Spreading Good Risk (24:42 - 25:03)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1482.68s-1503.24s):** "Or another reason when subscription policies might be used is when a broker wants to spread a good risk among markets. So say for example you have a good risk, it's high quality, it's low likelihood of claim and you want to develop good relationships with multiple insurers. Instead of ensuring this risk with one company you might choose to subscribe it so everyone gets a piece of this good business."

| Spreading Good Risk |
|--------------------|
| Broker has a GREAT risk (high quality, low claims) |
| Wants to build relationships with multiple insurers |
| Shares the good business among several companies |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You're a broker with an amazing client—$5 million building, perfect safety record, never had a claim. Instead of giving ALL this good business to ONE insurer, you split it among 4 insurers. Now all 4 companies love you and want to do business with you!

## 📊 Characteristics of Subscription Policies (25:09 - 25:49)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1503.24s-1544.199s):** "So some characteristics of a subscription policy is that all the subscribers will share premiums and losses. For example if you have three companies subscribed for 33.33% each they would share basically a third of the premiums and a third of the losses evenly. Obviously that varies depending on what percentage of the risk they have subscribed to. Subscription policies are also negotiated separately. So it's a bit more work in the sense that the broker has to go to each company and negotiate the subscription terms. And finally claims are paid separately meaning each of those three companies in my previous example would be responsive for paying their claims separately."

| Subscription Policy Characteristics |
|------------------------------------|
| **Share premiums** - proportional to % |
| **Share losses** - proportional to % |
| **Negotiated separately** - broker talks to each company |
| **Claims paid separately** - each company pays their share |

### 📋 Transcript Example: 33.33% Split

| 3 Companies, Equal Shares |
|--------------------------|
| Company A: 33.33% of premium, 33.33% of losses |
| Company B: 33.33% of premium, 33.33% of losses |
| Company C: 33.33% of premium, 33.33% of losses |
| If $90,000 claim → each pays $30,000 |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Premium is $100,000/year. Split 3 ways:
> - Company A gets $33,333 in premium
> - Company B gets $33,333 in premium
> - Company C gets $33,333 in premium
> 
> Claim is $60,000. Split 3 ways:
> - Company A pays $20,000
> - Company B pays $20,000
> - Company C pays $20,000

## 👑 The Lead Insurer (25:49 - 26:13)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1544.199s-1573.159s):** "When it comes to a subscription policy there is a lead insure. The lead insure is either the first one to subscribe or the one with the largest stake. They are responsible for providing services like issuing the policy, doing endorsements, and also collecting the premiums to distribute. Unlike a reinsurance policy all insurers are listed on the policy."

| Lead Insurer |
|-------------|
| First to subscribe OR largest stake |
| Issues the policy |
| Handles endorsements |
| Collects and distributes premiums |
| ALL insurers listed on policy |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> One company is the "captain" of the subscription team:
> - They write the policy document
> - They collect ALL the premium money
> - They distribute shares to other insurers
> - They handle changes/endorsements
> 
> Usually it's whoever has the biggest piece of the pie or whoever signed up first.

### Difference from Reinsurance

| Subscription Policy | Reinsurance |
|--------------------|-------------|
| ALL insurers listed on policy | Only primary insurer on policy |
| Insured knows all companies | Insured doesn't see reinsurer |
| Direct relationship with all | Reinsurer hidden behind scenes |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> - **Subscription:** Your policy shows "Insured by: Company A (40%), Company B (30%), Company C (30%)"
> - **Reinsurance:** Your policy shows "Insured by: Company A" (but secretly Company A bought reinsurance from someone else that you never see)
