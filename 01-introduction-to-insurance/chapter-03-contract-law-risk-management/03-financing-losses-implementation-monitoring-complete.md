---

## 🎯 The Big Picture

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If you're going to RETAIN a risk (pay for it yourself), you need money! This section teaches you 5 ways to pay for losses, how to decide what to transfer vs retain, how to actually implement a risk plan, and how to monitor if it's working.

---

## 💰 Part 1: Financing Retained Losses

> 💡 **From Transcript (1013s-1022s):** "When it comes to retaining a loss, if that's the method that you choose for a particular loss, you have to find a way to pay for it. You have to find a way to finance the loss. And there's a couple ways we can do that."

### 5 Methods to Finance Losses:

| # | Method | Description |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **Current Expenses** | Pay from operating account |
| 2 | **Unfunded Reserve** | Empty account for tracking |
| 3 | **Funded Reserve** | Account with actual money set aside |
| 4 | **Borrowing** | Take out a loan |
| 5 | **Captive Insurance** | Your own insurance company |

---

### 1️⃣ Current Expenses

> 💡 **From Transcript (1024s-1031s):** "The first is called current expenses, meaning you use the income from your operating account in order to pay for the loss or the repair."

| Method | Current Expenses |
|--------|------------------|
| **What it is** | Pay from regular operating account |
| **Source** | Normal business income |
| **Good for** | Small, infrequent losses |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Just pay for it out of your normal bank account. Simple, but only works for small stuff.

---

### 2️⃣ Unfunded Reserve

> 💡 **From Transcript (1031s-1063s):** "The second method is what's called an unfunded reserve. This is a separate bank account that you have set up to pay for losses. It has no money in it, but it's just used for accounting purposes. So whenever you need to pay for a loss, you take money from your operating account, move it into the unfunded reserve account, and then use that reserve account to pay for the repairs or to pay for the loss. That way, it's very easy to track how much you've spent on those losses. All you need to do is pull the bank account statements for the unfunded reserve and it's all there for you to see."

| Method | Unfunded Reserve |
|--------|------------------|
| **What it is** | Separate empty bank account |
| **Purpose** | Tracking/accounting only |
| **How it works** | Move money from operating → reserve → pay loss |
| **Benefit** | Easy to see total loss spending |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Think of it like a separate checking account just for losses. Empty until you need it, but makes tracking costs super easy!

---

### 3️⃣ Funded Reserve

> 💡 **From Transcript (1063s-1074s):** "The third method is called the funded reserve. It's the same as the above, you have a separate account, but in this case there's actually money that you've set aside and put in that account in order to pay for those loss expenses."

| Method | Funded Reserve |
|--------|----------------|
| **What it is** | Separate account WITH money in it |
| **Purpose** | Ready cash for losses |
| **How it works** | Pre-fund → pay losses when they happen |
| **Benefit** | Immediate access to funds |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Like a savings account specifically for losses. Money is already there waiting!

---

### 4️⃣ Borrowing (⚠️ NOT RECOMMENDED)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1074s-1099s):** "The fourth method and maybe not recommended is borrowing. You can take out a loan in order to pay for a loss. If you choose this method, I would recommend setting up a line of credit in advance. What you don't want to do is have one of your buildings burned down and then you go and try to get a loan in order to rebuild that building. By that point it's too late, it'll take too long to process your loan request and it's an inefficient process for everybody."

| Method | Borrowing |
|--------|-----------|
| **What it is** | Take out a loan |
| **Recommended?** | ⚠️ NOT really |
| **If you must** | Set up line of credit IN ADVANCE |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Building Burns Down

| ❌ Don't Do This | ✅ Do This Instead |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Building burns → THEN try to get loan | Set up line of credit BEFORE anything happens |
| Too late, too slow | Ready to use when needed |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If your building burns down and you don't have a pre-arranged line of credit, you're in trouble. Banks don't give fast loans after disasters!

---

### 5️⃣ Captive Insurance

> 💡 **From Transcript (1099s-1127s):** "The final method is what's called captive insurance. This is an insurance company that an organization has set up for the sole purpose of funding losses for that company. This is a technique that is commonly only available for large companies. Think about large multinational companies like Air Canada, General Electric, only those types of companies can use captive insurance."

| Method | Captive Insurance |
|--------|-------------------|
| **What it is** | Your OWN insurance company |
| **Purpose** | Fund losses for your own organization |
| **Who uses it** | Large multinationals only |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Air Canada, GE

| Companies That Use Captive Insurance |
|-------------------------------------|
| Air Canada |
| General Electric |
| Large multinational companies only |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Imagine owning your own insurance company just to insure yourself. Only mega-corporations like Air Canada can do this!

---

## 📊 Summary: 5 Financing Methods

| # | Method | Money Ready? | Who Uses It |
|---|--------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Current Expenses** | No (use income) | Anyone |
| 2 | **Unfunded Reserve** | No (tracking only) | Anyone |
| 3 | **Funded Reserve** | Yes (pre-funded) | Prepared businesses |
| 4 | **Borrowing** | No (need loan) | Not recommended! |
| 5 | **Captive Insurance** | Yes (own insurer) | Large corporations |

## ⚖️ Part 2: Large vs Small Loss Principle

> 💡 **From Transcript (1127s-1168s):** "Another critical concept to selecting and implementing the right risk management techniques is understanding the large versus small loss principle. So when it comes to a large loss, something with a devastating loss potential, you likely want to transfer that via insurance. When it comes to small losses, those can often be retained because it's cheaper to retain them and pay for them out of pocket than buying insurance for them."

### The Principle:

| Loss Size | Best Method | Why |
|-----------|-------------|-----|
| **Large** (devastating) | **Transfer** (insurance) | Can't afford to pay yourself |
| **Small** (minor) | **Retain** (pay yourself) | Cheaper than insurance |

---

### 📋 Transcript Example: Combination Approach

> 💡 **From Transcript (1151s-1168s):** "Typically, you would use a combination of the two. For example, you would purchase property insurance to take care of the big things like fire and earthquake, but then you would put a large deductible on it so then you could retain small losses like vandalism or small sort of damage."

| Strategy | Details |
|----------|---------|
| **Property insurance** | Covers fire, earthquake |
| **Large deductible** | You pay first $5,000-$10,000+ |
| **Result** | Big losses = insured, Small losses = retained |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Get insurance for the big stuff (fire, earthquake), but use a high deductible so you pay for small stuff (vandalism, minor damage) yourself. Best of both worlds!

---

## 🏗️ Part 3: Implementation Responsibilities

> 💡 **From Transcript (1168s-1220s):** "Now, once you've selected the right risk management techniques to use, now it comes down to actual implementation and knowing who's responsible for what."

### Two Types of Decisions:

| Type | Who Makes Them | What They Do |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| **Technical** | Line authority | Direct staff to take actions |
| **Managerial** | Staff authority | Advise but not direct |

---

### Technical Decisions (Line Authority)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1177s-1209s):** "So the technical decisions comes down to deciding how to implement the plan. For example, those with line authority can direct staff to take actions to implement certain parts of the plans and procedures."

### 📋 Transcript Example: Hot Roofing Company

> 💡 **From Transcript (1193s-1209s):** "Going back to that example with the hot roofing company, the manager of the project, the project manager or the foreman, might instruct their staff that they have to stick around for a couple hours afterwards in order to keep an eye on it and make sure there are no embers or fires that have started."

| Role | Action |
|------|--------|
| Project manager/Foreman | Has line authority |
| Instruction | Staff must stay for hours after hot roofing |
| Purpose | Watch for embers/fires |

---

### Managerial Decisions (Staff Authority)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1209s-1220s):** "There's also managerial decisions. So who is responsible for implementing the phases of the plan? So people with staff authority can advise, but then not direct the staff."

| Staff Authority | Line Authority |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Can ADVISE | Can DIRECT |
| Cannot order staff | Can order staff |

---

### Senior Management Role

> 💡 **From Transcript (1220s-1236s):** "The successful implementation of any risk management plan relies on the senior management. They would be responsible for fair and equitable cost allocation, as well as figuring out how to reduce cost of loss, the prevention, reduction or retaining losses."

| Senior Management Responsibilities |
|-----------------------------------|
| Fair cost allocation |
| Reduce cost of loss |
| Decide: prevent, reduce, or retain |

---

## 🚨 Part 4: Emergency Response Plan

> 💡 **From Transcript (1236s-1253s):** "Another critical aspect of risk management selection and implementation is implementing an emergency response plan. The emergency response plan is what you do following an emergency. The priorities here should be safeguarding human and physical assets following a crisis."

### Emergency Response Plan Basics:

| Priority | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| **#1** | Safeguard HUMAN assets |
| **#2** | Safeguard PHYSICAL assets |

---

### Plan Requirements:

> 💡 **From Transcript (1253s-1283s):** "This plan has to be straightforward, easy to follow, you have to provide training on how to execute the plan and you also have to keep it constantly up to date."

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Straightforward** | Easy to understand |
| **Easy to follow** | Clear steps |
| **Training** | Everyone knows what to do |
| **Up to date** | Constantly reviewed |

---

### Emergency Response Team

> 💡 **From Transcript (1262s-1276s):** "Part of this will involve assembling an emergency response team. This is a small team managed by someone who can physically and psychologically lead in a crisis scenario. They have to be a clear thinker and able to work under pressure."

| Team Requirements |
|-------------------|
| **Small team** |
| **Leader who can handle crisis** |
| **Clear thinker** |
| **Works under pressure** |

---

### Clear Line of Command

> 💡 **From Transcript (1276s-1289s):** "The plan also has to outline a clear line of command as well as roles and responsibilities beforehand. If you're figuring out who's responsible for what in the middle of a crisis, it's already too late."

| Rule |
|------|
| Define roles and responsibilities BEFORE crisis |
| During crisis = TOO LATE to figure out |

---

### Plan Components:

> 💡 **From Transcript (1289s-1327s):** "The second important piece of it is to develop a plan, a plan that is compliant with regulations and protocols. You also have to plan financial as well as other resources that you need to tap into during or after an event."

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Regulatory compliance** | Follow rules and protocols |
| **Financial resources** | Money available for crisis |
| **Contact lists** | Names, phone numbers, emails, addresses |
| **Training** | Ongoing practice |
| **Communications** | Share info with those who need to know |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Contact Lists

> 💡 **From Transcript (1303s):** "For example, contact lists of people to reach out to including names, phone numbers, emails as well as their physical addresses."

| Contact List Should Include |
|----------------------------|
| Names |
| Phone numbers |
| Email addresses |
| Physical addresses |

---

### Practice Makes Perfect!

> 💡 **From Transcript (1311s-1319s):** "You also need to have ongoing training and practice the plan. If you never practice it, you will never know if you can use it when the time comes."

| Rule |
|------|
| **Practice the plan regularly** |
| Never practiced = Won't work in real emergency |

---

### Where to Find the Plan

> 💡 **From Transcript (1327s-1335s):** "Typically, the emergency response plan would be found in the employee manual."

| Location |
|----------|
| Employee manual |

---

## 📊 Part 5: Step 5 - Monitoring

> 💡 **From Transcript (1335s-1349s):** "The next step in the risk management process is monitoring. We want to monitor the processes and the things that we've put in place for effectiveness and modify as necessary to improve loss ratios and keep up with any changes to the business."

### What is Monitoring?

| Purpose |
|---------|
| Check if risk management is working |
| Modify as necessary |
| Improve loss ratios |
| Keep up with business changes |

---

### Broker's Role in Monitoring

> 💡 **From Transcript (1349s-1361s):** "Brokers need to stay up to date with new products and procedures to be as effective as possible with this. So that involves taking continuing education, further training as well as learning on the job."

| Broker Responsibilities |
|------------------------|
| Stay updated on products |
| Continuing education |
| Further training |
| Learning on the job |

---

### Annual Review

> 💡 **From Transcript (1361s-1399s):** "One of the most important things when it comes to monitoring is performing an annual review of the risk management plan. During this review, you will determine if changes are needed and whether corrective actions are required. If yes, then identify what needs to be done and what needs to happen. The frequency of the review might not always happen annually. It depends on the complexity and the size of business, but minimum once a year is recommended."

| Annual Review |
|---------------|
| Determine if changes needed |
| Identify corrective actions |
| Minimum once per year |
| More often for complex businesses |

---

### Timing: During Renewals!

> 💡 **From Transcript (1388s-1399s):** "This helps you stay informed of any operational changes and is something you should bring up during renewal around the time you're starting to gather underwriting information in order to renew the policy."

| When to Review |
|----------------|
| **During renewal period** |
| When gathering underwriting info |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Perfect time to review risk management is when you're renewing the policy anyway!

---

### Standards and Benchmarks

> 💡 **From Transcript (1399s-1427s):** "So after you've implemented the risk management program, you need to set standards and benchmarks. So there are activity standards, which are what activities we need to achieve a result. The activity standards can be set based on internal historical data or industry-wide information."

| Standard Type | What It Measures |
|---------------|------------------|
| **Activity Standards** | What activities to do |
| **Performance Standards** | How well you're doing |

---

### Loss Control Measures

> 💡 **From Transcript (1436s-1454s):** "You also have various loss control measures. You need to check for the implementation of these. If the loss control measures don't meet the standard, then you may need to revise or replace those methods or controls. You may need to check whether there are other products or policies out there that can better meet the organization's needs."

| If Loss Control Doesn't Meet Standard |
|--------------------------------------|
| Revise the methods |
| Replace controls |
| Find better products/policies |

---

### Reviewing Results

> 💡 **From Transcript (1454s-1483s):** "When it comes to reviewing the results of a risk management program, you would check the effectiveness of the program through reviewing each department and each employee's results. What is the expected result versus the outcome? You need to check for variances between the expected outcome and what you've actually achieved. If there are any new or additional exposures, changes to the risk management plan might be required."

| Review Process |
|----------------|
| Check each department's results |
| Check each employee's results |
| Compare expected vs actual |
| Look for variances |
| Identify new exposures |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Changes Needed

> 💡 **From Transcript (1478s-1483s):** "For example, you might need to change your policies and procedures or increase the coverage on your insurance. This is something that you should bring up and discuss with your client."

| If Changes Needed |
|-------------------|
| Change policies/procedures |
| Increase insurance coverage |
| Discuss with client! |

---

### Comparing Similar Operations

> 💡 **From Transcript (1486s-1529s):** "Another critical process in the monitoring stage is comparing and reviewing records of other similar operations or businesses. You can look at past records and past losses to identify those loss exposures to help you predict the future. Because if something happened before, it's likely to occur again."

| Comparison Process |
|-------------------|
| Review similar businesses |
| Look at past losses |
| Predict future exposures |
| **Rule:** If it happened before, it will happen again! |

---

### What Information to Review

> 💡 **From Transcript (1505s-1529s):** "Some information you might look at would be the date of loss, claims amount, as well as the loss details. If you are operating your business in a stable environment with an extensive record or history of recorded claims, this can increase your accuracy of your loss predictions and therefore help you be better at avoiding losses in the future."

| Information to Review |
|----------------------|
| Date of loss |
| Claims amount |
| Loss details |

| More History = Better Predictions |
|----------------------------------|
| Stable environment + extensive records = accurate predictions |
