> **Timestamp:** 8:30 - 11:00 (510s - 660s) | **Chapter 08 - Part 5**

## 🏠 Legal Precedence for Liability (8:30 - 8:42)

> 💡 **From Transcript (510.16s-516.0s):** "In this section, I want to talk about some important legal precedence which determine where you might face liability risks."

> 💡 **From Transcript (516.0s-522.48s):** "Let's talk first about ownership of property. When you own property you're exposing yourself to many different liability risks."

| Ownership of Property |
|----------------------|
| Creates MANY liability risks |
| Different duties to different people |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> When you own property (home, business, land), you're responsible for what happens there. Different people who enter your property get different levels of protection from you.

---

## 👥 Four Types of People on Your Property (8:42 - 9:50)

> 💡 **From Transcript (522.48s-527.84s):** "As an occupier, you owe different duties to different types of people entering your premises."

| Four Types of Entrants |
|-----------------------|
| 1. **Trespassers** |
| 2. **Licensees** |
| 3. **Invitees** |
| 4. **Children** (special category) |

---

### 1. Trespassers 🚫

> 💡 **From Transcript (527.84s-532.96s):** "Trespassers are people who have entered your premises without permission."

> 💡 **From Transcript (532.96s-538.32s):** "The only duty you owe them is not to set traps or cause them any intentional harm."

| Trespassers |
|------------|
| = People who entered **WITHOUT permission** |
| **Your duty:** |
| - Don't set traps |
| - Don't cause intentional harm |
| That's IT! |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> A trespasser doesn't belong on your property. You owe them almost NOTHING—just don't intentionally hurt them. If someone breaks into your yard and trips on your garden hose, that's their problem. But if you set up a booby trap that hurts them, that's YOUR problem!

---

### 2. Licensees 📋

> 💡 **From Transcript (538.48s-544.32s):** "Licensees are people who have entered your premises for their own purpose but with permission from the occupier."

> 💡 **From Transcript (544.32s-550.4s):** "The duty you owe to licensees is to one of any dangers known to the occupier that they would not reasonably expect."

| Licensees |
|----------|
| = Entered for THEIR purpose but WITH permission |
| **Your duty:** |
| - Warn them of dangers YOU KNOW about |
| - That they wouldn't reasonably expect |

### 📋 Transcript Examples: Licensees

> 💡 **From Transcript (550.4s-557.44s):** "Examples of licensees include mailmen, roofers and other such contractors."

| Examples of Licensees |
|----------------------|
| Mailmen |
| Roofers |
| Contractors |
| Delivery people |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> A licensee comes to YOUR property for THEIR own reason (like a delivery person or repair worker). You didn't invite them for YOUR benefit—they're there for their job. Your duty? Tell them about any dangers YOU know about that they wouldn't expect.
> 
> Example: Your back steps are rotting. You know this. Tell the roofer before he falls through!

---

### 3. Invitees 🎟️

> 💡 **From Transcript (557.44s-565.68s):** "Invites are people invited in for the benefit of the example for business purposes or as a customer to purchase products."

> 💡 **From Transcript (565.68s-571.839s):** "The duty you owed invitees is to protect them against any dangers you know of or you might reasonably discover if you actually took the time to look."

| Invitees |
|---------|
| = Invited for YOUR benefit (business, customers) |
| **Your duty:** |
| - Protect against dangers you KNOW about |
| - AND dangers you SHOULD know (if you looked) |
| Highest duty! |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Invitees are people you ASKED to come—customers at your store, clients at your office. They're there because YOU want them there. You owe them the HIGHEST level of care:
> - Know about dangers AND
> - Look for dangers you MIGHT have missed
> 
> A store MUST check its floors for spills, even if they didn't personally spill anything!

---

### 4. Children 👶 (Special Protection)

> 💡 **From Transcript (577.199s-583.839s):** "Children are a special class of entity and they are protected by law."

> 💡 **From Transcript (584.4s-588.8s):** "The duty you owe to children is to make sure that the premises is safe from all dangers."

| Children |
|---------|
| **Special class protected by law** |
| **Your duty:** |
| - Make premises safe from ALL dangers |
| Highest protection! |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Children can't protect themselves from danger the way adults can. If a kid wanders onto your property, you can't say "well, they should've known not to touch that." Courts give children MAXIMUM protection. If you have a swimming pool, trampoline, or other "attractive nuisance," you must secure it!

## 📜 Occupiers' Liability Act (BC, AB, ON, NS) (9:50 - 10:07)

> 💡 **From Transcript (589.68s-596.079s):** "In BC, Alberta, Ontario, and Nova Scotia, we use something called the Occupiers' Liability Act."

> 💡 **From Transcript (596.079s-602.719s):** "This combines both licensees and invitees into one category called visitor."

> 💡 **From Transcript (602.719s-606.959s):** "The duty you owe to visitors is to make sure they are reasonably safe for the purpose of their visit."

| Occupiers' Liability Act |
|-------------------------|
| Provinces: BC, Alberta, Ontario, Nova Scotia |
| Combines licensees + invitees = **VISITOR** |
| **Duty:** Reasonably safe for purpose of visit |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> In BC, Alberta, Ontario, and Nova Scotia, they simplified the rules:
> - Licensee + Invitee = "Visitor"
> - Your duty: Keep premises "reasonably safe for why they're there"
> 
> Easier to apply—you don't have to figure out if someone is a licensee or invitee!

---

## 🏙️ Duty to People OUTSIDE Your Premises (10:07 - 10:33)

> 💡 **From Transcript (609.04s-614.079s):** "Now what kind of duty do you owe to people outside the premises? Essentially you have to make sure nothing you do in the building leaks out and causes harm to other people."

> 💡 **From Transcript (614.08s-618.08s):** "The duty you owe them is related to the use of the building as well as the maintenance of the building."

| Duty to People OUTSIDE |
|-----------------------|
| Make sure nothing "leaks out" and harms people |
| Related to: |
| - USE of building |
| - MAINTENANCE of building |

### 📋 Transcript Examples: Outside Duties

> 💡 **From Transcript (619.68s-624.96s):** "For example you can't release toxic fumes and you have to maintain any overhang signs such that it doesn't fall down and hit a pedestrian on the head."

| Examples |
|---------|
| Don't release **toxic fumes** |
| Maintain **overhanging signs** |
| Don't let things fall on pedestrians |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Even if someone never enters your property, you still owe them a duty! Your building can't harm passers-by:
> - Your factory can't release toxic fumes
> - Your storefront sign can't fall on someone's head
> - Your tree can't drop branches on the sidewalk
> 
> Keep your property from ESCAPING and hurting others!

## 🏢 Landlord Liability (10:33 - 11:00)

> 💡 **From Transcript (636.08s-641.76s):** "Now what about landlords? What are landlords liable for?"

### When Landlords Are Liable

> 💡 **From Transcript (641.76s-647.2s):** "Landlords can be liable when the incorrectly sworn fitness of the premises for a particular use or when they conceal an adverse condition."

| Landlords Liable When: |
|-----------------------|
| 1. Incorrectly guarantee fitness for use |
| 2. Conceal adverse (dangerous) condition |

---

### 📋 Transcript Example: Gym Floor Collapse

> 💡 **From Transcript (647.2s-653.52s):** "So if you hide a dangerous condition or incorrectly guarantee fitness for a particular use you could be liable."

> 💡 **From Transcript (653.52s-659.52s):** "An example would be if you were renting a second for premises and you had a tenant who asks you if the premises is fit for a gym."

> 💡 **From Transcript (659.52s-666.16s):** "If you say yes and he moves in his weight equipment and is too much of the floor to handle it collapses and hurts someone, the landlord would be liable."

> 💡 **From Transcript (666.24s-672.24s):** "This is because you guaranteed that the premises was fit for gym use when actually it was not."

| Gym Example |
|------------|
| **Tenant asks:** "Is this space fit for a gym?" |
| **Landlord says:** "Yes!" |
| **Reality:** Floor can't handle heavy equipment |
| **Result:** Floor collapses, someone gets hurt |
| **Landlord is LIABLE!** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> If a tenant asks "can I use this for X?" and you say YES without knowing for sure, you're on the hook!
> 
> The landlord said the floor could handle gym equipment when it couldn't. When the floor collapsed, the landlord was responsible—he GUARANTEED fitness and was WRONG.

---

### More Times Landlords Are Liable

> 💡 **From Transcript (672.24s-679.439s):** "Landlords can also be liable when they rent a furnished premises because when you do that it's assumed fit for the purpose it was furnished."

> 💡 **From Transcript (679.439s-683.92s):** "You're also liable when the landlord agrees to maintain the premises but you fail to do so after having been given enough notice."

> 💡 **From Transcript (683.92s-694.64s):** "and landlord would also be liable for common areas."

| More Landlord Liabilities |
|--------------------------|
| **Furnished premises:** Assumed fit for that purpose |
| **Agreed to maintain:** Fail to maintain after notice |
| **Common areas:** Always landlord's responsibility |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> More ways landlords can be liable:
> 1. **Furnished place:** You rent a furnished office? It better be safe for an office!
> 2. **Agreed to fix stuff:** Tenant reported broken railing 3 times and you ignored it? You're liable if someone falls.
> 3. **Common areas:** Hallways, lobby, parking lot—always your responsibility.

---

## 🏠 Tenant Liability (10:50 - 11:00)

> 💡 **From Transcript (694.64s-700.8s):** "Now let's talk about liability of tenants. If you're a tenant, you could be liable to your landlord for property damage."

> 💡 **From Transcript (700.8s-706.96s):** "Under toward law tenants are liable for damages caused by negligence."

> 💡 **From Transcript (706.96s-712.88s):** "Under contract law tenants can assume some extra liability in their lease agreement."

| Tenant Liability |
|-----------------|
| Liable to landlord for **property damage** |
| **Tort law:** Liable for negligent damages |
| **Contract law:** Can assume extra liability in lease |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> As a tenant:
> - If you're careless and damage the property, you owe the landlord
> - Your lease might add MORE responsibilities (like caring for appliances)
> - Read your lease carefully—you might be liable for more than you think!
