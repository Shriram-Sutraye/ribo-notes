## 🔍 What Impairs Proving a Tort (7:00 - 7:40)

> 💡 **From Transcript (422.16s-428.32s):** "So normally it would be up to the plaintiff to prove those three elements of a tort. However, the ability of a plaintiff to actually prove those three elements of a tort can be impaired."

| When It's Hard to Prove a Tort |
|-------------------------------|
| Normally: Plaintiff proves 3 elements |
| But: Several factors can IMPAIR this |

---

### Factor 1: Force Majeure

> 💡 **From Transcript (428.4s-433.52s):** "if the tort occurred due to a force majeure, meaning an unexpected or uncontrollable event."

| Force Majeure |
|--------------|
| = "Superior Force" (French) |
| Unexpected or uncontrollable event |
| Examples: Natural disasters, acts of God |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> "Force majeure" is French for "superior force." It means something CRAZY happened that nobody could control:
> - Earthquake
> - Hurricane
> - Flood
> - Pandemic
> 
> If a tornado destroyed your stuff, you can't blame the neighbor. It was an "act of God."

---

### Factor 2: Plaintiff Contributed

> 💡 **From Transcript (433.52s-439.92s):** "If the plaintiff's actions somehow led to the situation or contributed to it."

| Contributory Negligence |
|------------------------|
| Plaintiff's OWN actions contributed |
| Plaintiff helped cause the problem |
| Reduces or eliminates defendant's liability |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> If YOU partly caused your own injury, you can't fully blame the other person. Example: You were jaywalking when a car hit you. Sure, the driver should've been careful, but YOU shouldn't have been jaywalking! Your negligence contributed to the accident.

---

### Factor 3: Deliberate Action by Plaintiff/Third Party

> 💡 **From Transcript (439.92s-444.08s):** "or if there was a deliberate action taken by the plaintiff or by a third party that led to this scenario occurring."

| Intervening Actions |
|--------------------|
| Plaintiff took deliberate action |
| OR a third party interfered |
| Breaks the chain of causation |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> If YOU (the plaintiff) did something deliberate that caused the harm, or if someone ELSE (third party) jumped in and caused the harm, then the original defendant can't be fully blamed. The chain of events was BROKEN by someone else's deliberate act.

---

### Factor 4: Voluntary Assumption of Risk

> 💡 **From Transcript (444.08s-449.44s):** "or if the plaintiff has consented to the activity because in that case they have a voluntary assumption of risk."

> 💡 **From Transcript (449.44s-454.32s):** "For example, if they agreed to participate in a combat sport."

| Voluntary Assumption of Risk |
|-----------------------------|
| Plaintiff **CONSENTED** to the activity |
| Voluntarily accepted the risk |
| Can't sue for expected dangers |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Combat Sport

| Combat Sport Example |
|---------------------|
| **Scenario:** You sign up for boxing |
| **What happened:** You get punched and injured |
| **Can you sue:** NO! |
| **Why:** You AGREED to risk being punched |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You can't sign up for boxing, get punched, and then sue the other boxer for assault! By stepping into the ring, you ACCEPTED that punches are part of the deal. Same with skydiving, bungee jumping, etc.—if you voluntarily do something risky, you can't sue when the expected risks happen.

## 📋 Summary: 4 Factors That Impair Proving a Tort

| Factor | What It Means | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **1. Force Majeure** | Uncontrollable event | Tornado, earthquake, flood |
| **2. Contributory Negligence** | Plaintiff partly caused it | Jaywalking when hit by car |
| **3. Intervening Action** | Third party actions | Someone else interfered |
| **4. Voluntary Risk** | Plaintiff consented | Boxing, combat sports |

## ⚠️ What is Negligence? (7:42 - 8:00)

> 💡 **From Transcript (462.719s-468.32s):** "Now what is negligence? Negligence is basically carelessness. It's the failure to use the care of a reasonable and prudent person given the circumstances."

| Negligence Definition |
|----------------------|
| = **CARELESSNESS** |
| Failure to use care of a reasonable person |
| Given the circumstances |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Negligence = being careless when you should've been careful. Ask yourself: "What would a reasonable, normal person do in this situation?" If you did less than that, you were negligent.

---

### Two Ways to Be Negligent

> 💡 **From Transcript (468.32s-474.8s):** "So it really varies case by case. However, it basically means you've acted in a way you shouldn't have or you fail to act when you should have."

| Two Forms of Negligence |
|------------------------|
| **1. Commission:** You DID something you shouldn't |
| **2. Omission:** You FAILED to do something you should |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Two ways to be negligent:
> 1. **You DID something wrong** (drove too fast, threw something dangerously)
> 2. **You DIDN'T do something right** (didn't put up a wet floor sign, didn't fix a broken railing)
> 
> Both are negligence!

---

## 📋 Proving Negligence in Court (8:00 - 8:10)

> 💡 **From Transcript (474.8s-479.68s):** "If someone is suing you for negligence, the plaintiff must prove that you owe them a legal duty and that the legal duty was breached by negligence."

> 💡 **From Transcript (479.68s-484.4s):** "And of course, that damage is resulted."

| To Prove Negligence |
|--------------------|
| Same 3 elements as tort: |
| 1. Legal duty owed |
| 2. Legal duty breached BY NEGLIGENCE |
| 3. Damages resulted |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> To win a negligence case, you prove:
> 1. "They had a duty to be careful around me"
> 2. "They broke that duty by being CARELESS"
> 3. "And I got hurt because of their carelessness"

---

## 🛡️ The Foreseeability Defense (8:10 - 8:20)

> 💡 **From Transcript (484.4s-489.2s):** "However, there is a defense called foreseeability."

> 💡 **From Transcript (489.2s-496.24s):** "The defendant is not negligent if the outcome of their actions was not reasonably foreseeable."

| Foreseeability Defense |
|-----------------------|
| IF the outcome was NOT foreseeable |
| THEN defendant is NOT negligent |
| "A reasonable person couldn't have predicted this" |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> If you couldn't have PREDICTED the harm, you're not negligent. 
> 
> Example: You sell someone a balloon. They inhale the helium, pass out, hit their head. Could you predict that?! No! You're not negligent—it was unforeseeable.
> 
> But: You leave a banana peel on the floor. Could you predict someone might slip? YES! That's foreseeable, so you ARE negligent.

---

## 🏢 What Happens When You're Sued for Negligence (8:20 - 8:30)

> 💡 **From Transcript (496.24s-503.12s):** "If you are sued for negligence and you have liability insurance, the insurance company will find and pay for a lawyer to defend you."

| When You're Sued for Negligence |
|-------------------------------|
| If you have liability insurance: |
| Insurance company FINDS a lawyer |
| Insurance company PAYS for the lawyer |
| They defend you in court |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> If someone sues you for negligence and you have liability insurance, you don't have to worry about finding or paying for a lawyer. Your insurance company hires one FOR you and pays the legal bills. That's a huge benefit of liability insurance!

## 🧠 Quick Memory Hooks - Part 4

> [!TIP]
> **Memory Tricks:**
> - **Force Majeure = "Force of God"** (uncontrollable events)
> - **Contributory = "You contributed too!"** (plaintiff partly at fault)
> - **Voluntary Risk = "You signed up for this!"** (can't sue for expected danger)
> - **Negligence = "Carelessness"** (acted wrong OR failed to act)
> - **Foreseeability = "Could I see it coming?"** (if no → not negligent)
> - **Two Types of Negligence:** "Commission (you DID) or Omission (you DIDN'T)"
