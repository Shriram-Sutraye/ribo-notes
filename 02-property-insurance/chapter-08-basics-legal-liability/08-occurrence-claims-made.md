## 📊 Limits of Insurance (19:00 - 19:18)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1161.6s-1176.0s):** "The limits of insurance apply per occurrence. If you purchase a $5 million liability limit, you will have $5 million per occurrence."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1176.0s-1181.52s):** "There might also be an aggregate limit, which is the maximum for all claims made during that policy period."

| Types of Limits |
|----------------|
| **Per Occurrence:** Limit for each incident |
| **Aggregate:** Maximum for ALL claims in policy period |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Two types of limits:
> - **Per Occurrence:** $5M per accident (each incident capped at $5M)
> - **Aggregate:** Maybe $10M total for the year (all accidents combined can't exceed $10M)

---

### Split Limits

> 💡 **From Transcript (1181.52s-1187.84s):** "There may also be split limits. A split limit is a separate limit for per person injury, injury of everybody, and property damage."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1187.919s-1192.959s):** "So you can think of this sort of sub-limit."

| Split Limits |
|-------------|
| Separate limits for: |
| - Per person injury |
| - All persons injured |
| - Property damage |
| Like "sub-limits" |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Split limits are like putting limits on different categories:
> - $100K per person who gets hurt
> - $300K total for all people hurt in one accident
> - $50K for property damage
> 
> Written as: 100/300/50

---

## 📋 Two Forms of Liability Insurance (19:38 - 20:10)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1198.0s-1203.6s):** "Liability insurance generally comes in two forms. It can be an occurrence form or a claims made form."

| Two Forms |
|----------|
| **1. Occurrence Form** |
| **2. Claims Made Form** |

---

## ✅ Occurrence Form (20:10 - 20:45)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1204.399s-1208.959s):** "Under an occurrence form, coverage is triggered when the actual accident or the incident itself happens during the policy period."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1208.959s-1214.56s):** "regardless of when the claim was reported."

| Occurrence Form |
|----------------|
| Coverage triggered: When **INCIDENT happens** |
| During policy period |
| **Regardless of when claim reported** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> **Occurrence form focuses on WHEN IT HAPPENED.**
> 
> If the accident happened while your policy was active, you're covered—even if the claim comes in 10 years later!

---

### Occurrence Form Benefits

> 💡 **From Transcript (1214.56s-1220.159s):** "So it emphasizes the occurrence time frame. If the incident happened while the policy was active, it's covered even if the claim was reported later."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1220.159s-1225.28s):** "This offers more continuity and coverage with policy changes, for example, if you switch to a different insurance provider."

| Occurrence Form Benefits |
|-------------------------|
| Emphasizes when incident occurred |
| Covered if policy was active then |
| **More continuity** if you switch insurers |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Occurrence forms give you PEACE OF MIND. If you switch insurance companies, you don't have to worry about old incidents. The policy that was active when it happened will STILL cover it.

---

### 📋 Transcript Example: 2023-2024 Policy

> 💡 **From Transcript (1225.28s-1228.96s):** "For example, if the accident occurred during the 2023-2024 policy term."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1229.919s-1236.399s):** "when it was discovered in 2025 and reported then, it would still be covered by the policy that was in place from 2023-2024."

| Example |
|--------|
| **Accident:** During 2023-2024 policy |
| **Discovered & reported:** 2025 |
| **Which policy pays:** 2023-2024 policy! |

> 💡 **From Transcript (1236.399s-1244.48s):** "So an occurrence form triggers based on when the actual accident or incident occurred."

---

## 📝 Claims Made Form (20:45 - 21:15)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1245.2s-1251.84s):** "This is different from a claims made form where a coverage is triggered when a claim is filed during the policy period or during the extended reporting period."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1252.56s-1257.679s):** "So with the claims made form, we're focused on when the incident was reported, not necessarily when it happened."

| Claims Made Form |
|-----------------|
| Coverage triggered: When **CLAIM IS FILED** |
| During policy period or ERP |
| Focuses on **WHEN REPORTED** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> **Claims made form focuses on WHEN YOU REPORT IT.**
> 
> It doesn't matter when the incident happened. What matters is: Was your policy active when you REPORTED the claim?

---

### Claims Made Requirements

> 💡 **From Transcript (1257.679s-1263.04s):** "So it emphasizes the reporting time frame."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1263.04s-1268.08s):** "The claim must be filed within the specific window for coverage to apply."

| Claims Made Requirements |
|------------------------|
| Emphasizes **reporting time frame** |
| Claim must be filed within specific window |
| If window closes, no coverage! |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Claims made forms have a LIMITED WINDOW to report claims. If you miss that window, you're out of luck—even if the incident happened while you were insured.

---

## ⚠️ Gap Problems When Switching (21:15 - 22:00)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1268.08s-1274.56s):** "So you can see when you switch between a claims made form and an occurrence form or vice versa, it can leave gaps in coverage."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1274.56s-1280.8s):** "especially if there's a past incident that isn't reported before the policy expires."

| Gap Risk |
|---------|
| Switching between forms = gaps! |
| Unreported past incidents = no coverage |

---

### Why Gaps Happen

> 💡 **From Transcript (1280.8s-1286.08s):** "Because once that claims made form has expired, you're not able to make a claim for incident that occurred during that time because that window has passed."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1286.08s-1291.679s):** "that policy's no longer enforced."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1292.159s-1296.24s):** "And the occurrence form wasn't active in the past when the incident occurred so the occurrence form wouldn't respond either."

| Gap Scenario |
|-------------|
| Claims made expires → can't claim old incidents |
| New occurrence form → wasn't active when incident happened |
| **NEITHER policy responds!** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Imagine:
> - 2023: You had claims made policy
> - 2024: Something happened but you didn't know
> - 2025: You switch to occurrence policy
> - 2026: You discover the 2024 incident
> 
> The 2023 policy is expired (can't report). The 2025 occurrence policy wasn't active in 2024 (won't pay). You have NOTHING!

> 💡 **From Transcript (1296.24s-1301.44s):** "So to be very careful when you switch your clients between a claims made form to an occurrence form."

> [!WARNING]
> **CRITICAL:** Be very careful switching between claims made and occurrence forms. Gaps can leave clients uninsured!

---

## 📅 Retroactive Date (22:00 - 22:45)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1301.44s-1307.2s):** "So there's a concept in claims made forms called the retroactive date. Basically, it's the cut-off date in the past for when we would provide coverage."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1307.2s-1312.96s):** "So when you set a retroactive date to say March 30th, 2025 anything that occurred before that date would not be covered."

| Retroactive Date |
|-----------------|
| Cut-off date in the past |
| Incidents BEFORE this date = NOT covered |
| Example: March 30, 2025 |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Retroactive date = "We won't cover anything from before this date."
> 
> If your retroactive date is March 30, 2025:
> - Incident on March 29, 2025? NOT covered
> - Incident on April 1, 2025? Covered (if reported in time)

---

### Matching Retroactive Dates

> 💡 **From Transcript (1318.48s-1324.32s):** "So when you're switching insurers even on a claims made form, you want to ensure that the new policy matches the expiring policies retroactive date."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1324.88s-1329.12s):** "otherwise there's a gap in coverage unless you purchase an extended reporting period endorsement."

| When Switching Insurers |
|------------------------|
| **MATCH** the retroactive dates! |
| If new policy's retroactive date is later = GAP |
| Solution: Extended Reporting Period (ERP) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Switching from Insurer A to Insurer B?
> - Insurer A's retroactive date: 2020
> - Insurer B must ALSO go back to 2020
> 
> If Insurer B only goes back to 2024, anything from 2020-2024 has NO COVERAGE!

---

## 📋 Extended Reporting Period (ERP) (22:45 - 23:30)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1329.199s-1339.36s):** "So the extended reporting period endorsement basically allows additional time post policy expiry to file claims under the old policy."

| Extended Reporting Period |
|--------------------------|
| = Additional time AFTER policy expires |
| To file claims under OLD policy |
| Bridges the gap |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> ERP is like getting EXTRA TIME. Even after your claims made policy ends, you can still report incidents that happened during that policy period. It's insurance overtime!

---

### 📋 Transcript Example: 2022 Incident with ERP

> 💡 **From Transcript (1339.36s-1353.199s):** "So let's use an example. Let's say you had an occurrence in 2022 and your policy as it claims made form. If you had maintained continuous coverage with that same policy the same is sure from 2022 to when the incident was reported in 2024, that incident would be covered."

| Scenario 1: Same Insurer |
|-------------------------|
| Incident: 2022 |
| Same insurer: 2022-2024 |
| Reported: 2024 |
| **COVERED!** ✅ |

> 💡 **From Transcript (1353.199s-1365.44s):** "The retroactive date was back in 2022 and the policy was first put in place. Therefore you have coverage when you reported in 2024."

---

### What Happens When You Switch

> 💡 **From Transcript (1365.44s-1376.32s):** "If you had switched insurance companies part way, let's say from the 2022 to 2023 period you were with company A from 2023 to 2024 and the company B policy did not match the retroactive date."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1376.399s-1383.12s):** "In that case the company B policy would not respond because the incident happened before the retroactive date of that company B policy."

| Scenario 2: Switched Insurers |
|------------------------------|
| 2022-2023: Company A |
| 2023-2024: Company B (retroactive date = 2023) |
| Incident: 2022 |
| **NOT COVERED!** ❌ |
| Why: Happened before Company B's retroactive date |

---

### ERP Saves the Day

> 💡 **From Transcript (1383.12s-1395.439s):** "That's why the extended reporting period endorsement is important. If you had purchased that when you switched the policy in 2023, the old policy would have responded because it was reported during that extended period."

| Scenario 3: Used ERP |
|---------------------|
| 2022-2023: Company A + ERP purchased |
| Company A responds to 2022 incident |
| **COVERED!** ✅ |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> When switching from Company A to Company B:
> 1. **Without ERP:** Old incident = no coverage
> 2. **With ERP:** Old incident = covered under Company A's extension

---

## 🔄 Occurrence vs Claims Made: Flexibility (23:30 - 24:00)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1400.88s-1406.56s):** "So technically speaking, occurrence forms have a lot more flexibility than claims made forms as far as coverage goes."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1406.56s-1418.96s):** "because I could have purchased a current policy in 1995. Something happened then I reported it in 2025. Technically speaking, the 1995 policy would respond."

| Occurrence Form Advantage |
|--------------------------|
| Much MORE flexible |
| 1995 policy still responds in 2025! |
| Can go back DECADES |

> 💡 **From Transcript (1418.96s-1426.96s):** "so I can call up that insurance company from 10 years ago and they would actually have to respond to that incident."

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Occurrence forms can respond to VERY old incidents:
> - Something happened in 1995
> - You report it in 2025
> - The 1995 insurance company has to pay!
> 
> Claims made forms can't do this because of expiration windows.
