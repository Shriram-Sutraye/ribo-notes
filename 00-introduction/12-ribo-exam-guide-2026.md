## 🚀 2026 Success Strategies

1. **Master the PDF Navigation:** Don't waste time scrolling. Know exactly where the RIB Act vs. OAP 1 sections are located in the consolidated document.
2. **Focus on Auto (OAP 1):** 25% of the exam is Auto. The OAP 1 is in your open-book PDF; learn to find information there quickly.
3. **Practice Application:** Use mock exams that give you scenarios (e.g., "A client does X, which exclusion applies?") rather than just definitions.
4. **Time Management:** You have roughly 1.5 minutes per question. If a question is too hard, flag it and move on.
5. **Ethics & By-laws:** These are "easy" points if you know the RIB Act. They often fall under General Insurance (25%).
