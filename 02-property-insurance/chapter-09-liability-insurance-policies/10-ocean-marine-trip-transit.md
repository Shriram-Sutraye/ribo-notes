## 🚢 Ocean Marine Cargo Policy (1655.78s - 1705.072s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1655.78s-1661.781s):** "The next type of insurance policy I want to discuss is an ocean marine cargo policy."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1661.781s - 1671.744s):** "Under this you have two types. You can get an individual policy which will ensure a single shipment, or if you ship often throughout the year, you can get an open policy which covers all shipments made throughout that policy term."

| Ocean Marine Cargo Types |
|-------------------------|
| **Individual Policy:** Single shipment |
| **Open Policy:** All shipments for the year |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Shipping goods by sea? Two options:
> - **Individual policy:** Insure ONE shipment (one-time)
> - **Open policy:** Insure ALL your shipments for the whole year (ongoing)
> 
> If you ship once, get individual. If you ship regularly, open policy is more convenient.

### What Determines Coverage? (1671.744s - 1698.43s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1674.624s-1680.226s):** "The type of coverage being offered will depend on the type of property being transported."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1680.226s-1682.827s):** "the origin of that property, the fragility of that property."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1682.827s-1688.668s):** "For example, is it easily damaged? Are there special handling instructions?"

> 💡 **From Transcript (1688.668s-1691.549s):** "What are the ports of calls or stops along the way?"

> 💡 **From Transcript (1691.549s-1698.43s):** "And also the method of transportation. Is it truck rail? Is it airplane? Is it by boat? How are we transporting those goods?"

| Factors Affecting Coverage |
|---------------------------|
| **Type of property** (what is it?) |
| **Origin** (where from?) |
| **Fragility** (easily damaged?) |
| **Special handling** needed? |
| **Ports of call** (stops along the way) |
| **Method of transport** (truck, rail, air, boat) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Insurance companies need to know:
> - What are you shipping? (Electronics vs. bricks)
> - Where does it come from? (Safe country vs. risky route)
> - Is it fragile? (Glass vs. steel)
> - Does it need special care? (Temperature-controlled?)
> - What ports will it stop at? (More stops = more risk)
> - How is it travelling? (Boat vs. plane vs. truck)
> 
> All of this affects your premium and coverage terms.

### Delays & Route Changes (1700.591s - 1705.072s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1700.591s-1705.072s):** "If goods are delayed during transit or if the route changes, they would still get coverage."

| Delays & Changes |
|-----------------|
| Goods delayed? STILL covered ✅ |
| Route changes? STILL covered ✅ |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> If your shipment is delayed or has to take a different route (maybe due to weather, port closures, etc.), your insurance STILL covers the goods. The policy follows the cargo, not the exact route planned.

## 🚚 Trip Transit Policy (1707.393s - 1735.4s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1707.393s-1714.194s):** "And finally we have the trip transit policy. Trip transit policies are used to ensure single shipments."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1714.194s-1720.676s):** "For example, if you're bringing in a new piece of equipment for your manufacturing facility, you might want to purchase a trip transit insurance policy for that piece of equipment."

| Trip Transit Policy |
|--------------------|
| For **SINGLE shipments** |
| One-time coverage |
| Example: New equipment delivery |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Buying a $500,000 piece of machinery from overseas? Just this one time, not regular shipments. Get a trip transit policy—it covers that ONE delivery from origin to your door.

---

### Premium Factors (1720.676s - 1728.118s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1720.676s-1728.118s):** "The premium will depend on the property as well as the transportation method and distance."

| Premium Depends On |
|-------------------|
| **Property:** Value, fragility |
| **Transport method:** Truck, rail, air, sea |
| **Distance:** How far is it travelling? |

---

### Coverage Basis (1728.118s - 1735.4s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1728.118s-1732.399s):** "You can get coverage on a named perils or all risk basis."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1732.399s-1735.4s):** "and the trip transit policy has the same terms and conditions as the transportation floater."

| Coverage Options |
|-----------------|
| **Named Perils:** Only listed perils |
| **All Risk:** Everything except exclusions |
| Same terms as transportation floater |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Just like other property insurance, you can choose:
> - **Named Perils:** Cheaper, only covers specific risks
> - **All Risk:** More expensive, covers almost everything
> 
> The trip transit policy works the same as a "transportation floater" we learned about in commercial property.
