> **Timestamp:** 183.086s - 366.173s (3:03 - 6:06) | **Chapter 09 - Part 3**

---

## 🌍 Coverage E = GLOBAL Coverage (183.086s - 200.291s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (183.086s-187.047s):** "So let's start this by talking about Coverage E personal liability. This section gives you global coverage for liability arising out of private activities."

> 💡 **From Transcript (187.047s-192.969s):** "This Coverage E personal liability insurance comes as a standard part of your homeowners, tenants, condo, and even mobile home policy."

| Coverage E - Global Coverage |
|------------------------------|
| **GLOBAL** coverage = Anywhere in the WORLD! |
| Covers liability from **private activities** |
| Comes STANDARD in all habitational policies |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Coverage E doesn't just protect you at home—it protects you EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD! On vacation in Paris and you accidentally knock an expensive vase off a display? Covered. At a friend's house in Toronto and their kid gets hurt because of something you did? Covered. This is "global" coverage for your PRIVATE (personal, non-business) activities.

> [!NOTE]
> **What "Private Activities" Means:**
> - Playing sports at the park
> - Walking your dog
> - Visiting friends
> - Going on vacation
> - Anything personal (NOT related to work or business)

## 🏠 What Coverage E Covers At Your Premises (200.291s - 225.297s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (200.291s-202.411s):** "Basically, any personal habitational insurance policy will probably come with Coverage E personal liability."

> 💡 **From Transcript (204.692s-207.253s):** "The intent of this coverage is to cover the insurance liability for any injury or damage at the insurance premises."

> 💡 **From Transcript (207.253s-213.254s):** "whether that's a premises that's owned, used, or otherwise occupied by the insured."

| What Coverage E Covers At Home |
|-------------------------------|
| Injury at your premises |
| Damage at your premises |
| Whether you **OWN, USE, or OCCUPY** the property |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Coverage E covers LIABILITY (lawsuits) for things that happen at YOUR place. It doesn't matter if you:
> - **OWN** the property (homeowner)
> - **USE** the property (maybe a seasonal rental)
> - **OCCUPY** the property (tenant)
> 
> If someone gets hurt or their stuff gets damaged at your place, and it's YOUR fault, Coverage E pays!

### 📋 Transcript Example: Kitchen Slip & Fall (213.254s - 228.218s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (215.335s-217.895s):** "For example, if someone comes to visit your home, they slip on some water in the kitchen."

> 💡 **From Transcript (217.895s-222.937s):** "and they hit their heads, and if you're liable for that, the coverage E personal liability coverage would respond."

| Example: Kitchen Slip & Fall |
|-----------------------------|
| **Scenario:** Guest visits your home |
| **What happened:** Slips on water in kitchen |
| **Result:** Hits their head, gets injured |
| **Your liability?** If you left the water there = YES |
| **Coverage E:** PAYS for their medical bills, lawsuit, etc. |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your friend comes over. You mopped the floor but didn't put up a "wet floor" sign. They slip, bang their head, and need 10 stitches. They sue you. Coverage E:
> - Pays for a lawyer to defend you
> - Pays for their medical bills if you lose
> - Pays the court judgment against you

> [!WARNING]
> **Important Nuance:** Notice it says "if you're LIABLE for that." If the guest was drunk and dancing on your counter and fell, that might be THEIR fault, not yours. Coverage E only pays if YOU are found at fault.

---

## 👷 Coverage E for Residence Employees (228.218s - 262.346s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (228.218s-232.979s):** "It will also respond to cover any injury or death of residence employees."

> 💡 **From Transcript (232.979s-234.78s):** "So it acts as a bit of an employer's liability coverage."

> 💡 **From Transcript (235.02s-236.7s):** "but you must show that the employer, meaning the insured, was liable."

| Coverage for Residence Employees |
|--------------------------------|
| Covers **injury or death** of residence employees |
| Acts like "employer's liability" |
| **BUT:** You must be LIABLE (at fault) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> If you have workers at your home (cleaners, landscapers, nannies), and they get hurt while working, Coverage E can pay. BUT there's a catch: You have to actually be AT FAULT for their injury. It's not automatic like Workers' Compensation.

---

### 📋 Transcript Example: Defective Ladder (236.7s - 262.346s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (239.021s-240.701s):** "For example, if somebody came over to do some work on your roof, maybe clean your gutters."

> 💡 **From Transcript (240.701s-244.542s):** "and you lent them your ladder and the ladder was faulty, it was old."

> 💡 **From Transcript (244.542s-248.783s):** "and it collapsed as they were trying to climb up and it injures that person."

> 💡 **From Transcript (248.783s-252.704s):** "And if they choose to sue you, you may be found liable because you supplied that defective ladder."

> 💡 **From Transcript (252.704s-259.586s):** "And so your Coverage E personal liability coverage would respond to pay for that."

| Example: Defective Ladder |
|--------------------------|
| **Scenario:** Worker comes to clean your gutters |
| **What you did:** Lent them YOUR old ladder |
| **Problem:** Ladder was faulty (you knew or should've known) |
| **Result:** Ladder collapses, worker gets injured |
| **Lawsuit:** They sue you for giving them a defective ladder |
| **Your liability?** YES—you supplied the faulty equipment! |
| **Coverage E:** PAYS for the lawsuit and damages |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> This is a HUGE example. You hired someone to clean your gutters. They don't have their own ladder, so you offer yours. But your ladder is 15 years old and has a rusty rung. It breaks. They fall 20 feet and break their back.
> 
> They sue you. Why? Because YOU gave them dangerous equipment. YOU were negligent. Coverage E pays because it's YOUR fault the worker got hurt.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Key Point - Fault Required:**
> If the worker brought their OWN ladder and it broke, that's NOT your fault. Coverage E wouldn't respond. You have to actually BE LIABLE for Coverage E to pay.

## ➕ Supplementary Payments (262.346s - 268.548s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (262.346s-263.987s):** "Of course, supplementary payments are covered as well, right?"

> 💡 **From Transcript (263.987s-266.227s):** "Look at the previous section to understand what that is."

| Supplementary Payments Reminder |
|--------------------------------|
| Cost of defense (lawyers) |
| Court costs |
| Interest on judgments |
| Bond premiums |
| ALL covered ON TOP of limits |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Remember from Chapter 08: Supplementary payments are EXTRA. They don't eat into your $1M limit. So if you have $1M Coverage E and win the case but spent $50K on lawyers, you STILL have the full $1M available. The $50K lawyer bill is "supplementary."

---

## ❌ EXCLUSIONS: What Coverage E Does NOT Cover (268.548s - 366.173s)

### Exclusion 1: Your Own Property (268.548s - 284.472s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (268.548s-271.429s):** "However, there are some exclusions. Any damage to property that you own, use, occupy, or lease is excluded."

> 💡 **From Transcript (274.39s-277.35s):** "Damage to property of others that are in the care, custody, and control of the insured is also excluded."

| Exclusion: Your Property |
|-------------------------|
| Property YOU own = NOT covered |
| Property YOU use = NOT covered |
| Property YOU lease = NOT covered |
| Property in YOUR care/custody = NOT covered |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You can't use Coverage E to fix YOUR OWN stuff. That's what property insurance is for! Also, if you're HOLDING someone else's property (babysitting their expensive vase), and you break it, Coverage E doesn't cover that either.
> 
> Why? Because when something is in your "care, custody, and control," the thinking is that you should be extra careful with it—it's YOUR responsibility.

### EXCEPTION: Fire, Explosion, Water, Smoke! (284.472s - 290.874s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (284.472s-286.473s):** "However, property of others is covered when it's caused by fire, explosion, water, or smoke."

> 💡 **From Transcript (286.473s-290.874s):** "excluding smoke from a fireplace."

| The "Fire Exception" |
|---------------------|
| Property of others IS covered if damage caused by: |
| **Fire** ✅ |
| **Explosion** ✅ |
| **Water** ✅ |
| **Smoke** ✅ (but NOT fireplace smoke) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> There's a BIG exception! If you damage someone else's property with fire, explosion, water, or smoke—it IS covered! Even if it was in your care.
> 
> Example: You're borrowing your friend's BBQ. You accidentally start a fire that burns down the rented cabin. The cabin (property of others) is covered because you damaged it with FIRE.

---

### 📋 Transcript Example: BBQ Burns Cabin (291.994s - 307.758s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (291.994s-295.115s):** "For example, there's no coverage if you accidentally damage the property you borrow or store from a friend."

> 💡 **From Transcript (298.036s-300.756s):** "But if you borrow a BBQ, you're barbecuing."

> 💡 **From Transcript (300.756s-302.757s):** "and you burn down the rented cabin, that would be covered."

> 💡 **From Transcript (302.757s-307.758s):** "because the rented cabin was damaged by fire."

| Example: BBQ Disaster |
|----------------------|
| **Scenario 1:** You drop your friend's borrowed camera → NOT covered |
| **Scenario 2:** You BBQ, fire spreads, burns down rented cabin → COVERED! |
| **Why the difference?** Camera = care/custody. Cabin = fire damage exception |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> - You borrow your friend's $2,000 camera and drop it → NOT covered (it was in your care)
> - You borrow your friend's BBQ, start grilling, grease fire starts, burns down the rental cabin you're staying at → COVERED! (fire damage to property of others)
> 
> Fire damage gets special treatment because fires can get out of control quickly and cause massive damage. The insurance industry provides this protection.

---

### Exclusion 2: Work Done On Property (307.758s - 314.96s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (307.758s-312.079s):** "any damage to property and fixtures from work done on them, By you, or on your behalf is not covered."

| Exclusion: Work Damage |
|-----------------------|
| Damage from WORK done on property = NOT covered |
| Whether YOU do the work or HIRE someone |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> If you try to fix your neighbor's deck and you mess it up—Coverage E doesn't pay. This is because work-related damage should be covered by a contractor's insurance (if you hired one) or you should've known the risks of DIY.

---

### Exclusion 3: Injury to Insured/Household (314.96s - 326.243s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (314.96s-316.84s):** "Any injury to the insured or anyone residing in the insured's household is also not covered."

> 💡 **From Transcript (319.361s-320.881s):** "because they're not considered a third party."

> 💡 **From Transcript (320.881s-323.842s):** "However, residents employees will be covered."

| Exclusion: Household Injury |
|----------------------------|
| Injury to YOU = NOT covered |
| Injury to HOUSEHOLD members = NOT covered |
| They're not "third parties" |
| **Exception:** Residence employees ARE covered |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Liability insurance pays THIRD PARTIES—people outside your household. You can't sue yourself! If your kid trips on your stairs, you can't claim liability coverage. That's a family matter.
> 
> BUT: If your CLEANER trips on your stairs, they CAN sue you, and Coverage E responds because they're a third party (not family).

---

### Exclusion 4: Non-Resident Named Insured (323.842s - 334.325s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (323.842s-327.843s):** "The actions of a named insured who's not residing at the premises is also not covered."

> 💡 **From Transcript (330.724s-334.325s):** "But if you're living in a care facility, that's ok, you do have coverage."

| Exclusion: Non-Resident Insured |
|-------------------------------|
| Named insured NOT living at premises = NOT covered |
| **Exception:** If living in a care facility = OK |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> If you're named on the policy but you don't actually LIVE there anymore, Coverage E doesn't protect you for that property.
> 
> **Exception:** If you're in a nursing home or assisted living, you're still covered. The insurance industry makes this exception because elderly people often move to care facilities but still own their home.

---

### Exclusion 5: Voluntary Assumption of Liability (335.525s - 362.572s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (335.525s-337.125s):** "There's also no coverage when the insured voluntarily assumes liability."

> 💡 **From Transcript (337.125s-342.127s):** "for example through a contract."

> 💡 **From Transcript (342.127s-346.528s):** "Except when it's insured in a contract in relation to the insured's premises."

| Exclusion: Voluntary Assumption |
|-------------------------------|
| You sign a contract taking on liability = NOT covered |
| **Exception:** If contract relates to YOUR premises |
| **Exception:** If you'd be liable anyway |

---

### 📋 Transcript Example: Contractor Indemnity (346.528s - 362.572s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (346.528s-348.728s):** "such as if you recently repaired a fence and it fell on someone."

> 💡 **From Transcript (348.728s-352.449s):** "but you've contractually indemnified the contractor that you hired to repair it."

> 💡 **From Transcript (352.449s-357.571s):** "your home insurance personal liability would cover it."

> 💡 **From Transcript (357.571s-362.572s):** "It would also cover contractual liability if the insured would have been liable for the loss anyways."

| Example: Fence Falls on Someone |
|-------------------------------|
| **Scenario:** You hired contractor to fix your fence |
| **Contract:** You signed an indemnity agreement |
| **What happened:** Fence falls on a visitor |
| **Result:** Even though you signed a contract, Coverage E pays! |
| **Why?** It's related to YOUR premises |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You hire a contractor to fix your fence. In the contract, you agreed to protect them from lawsuits (indemnify them). The fence falls on a visitor. Normally, if you "voluntarily assume liability" through a contract, Coverage E doesn't help.
> 
> **BUT:** Since this contract is about YOUR PREMISES (your fence, your property), Coverage E DOES cover it. This exception protects homeowners who sign standard contractor agreements.
