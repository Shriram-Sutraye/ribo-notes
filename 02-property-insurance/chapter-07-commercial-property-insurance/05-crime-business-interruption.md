## 🔓 Crime Insurance (31:29 - 33:43)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1889s):** Commercial property broad form only covers riot/vandalism. Need separate crime insurance.

### Three Types of Crime Insurance

| Type | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Burglary** | Theft with visible signs of force, nobody saw |
| **Robbery** | Theft with violence/threat, someone saw or was there |
| **Theft** | Taking without consent (broadest) |

> [!TIP] **Memory Trick:** 
> - **B**urglary = **B**reak-in (visible marks, nobody there)
> - **R**obbery = **R**ough (violence, person involved)
> - **T**heft = **T**ake (any unauthorized taking)

---

### 1. Burglary Insurance

#### A. Mercantile Stock Burglary
| Coverage |
|----------|
| Theft from enclosed premises |
| Visible signs of force to enter AND steal |
| Includes damage during burglary |

#### B. Safe Burglary
| Coverage |
|----------|
| Theft from a safe |
| Force used to enter safe OR remove it |
| Includes incidental damage (dragging safe damages stairs) |

---

### 2. Robbery Insurance

| Coverage |
|----------|
| Money, securities, valuable property |
| Taken by force/threat to a **custodian** |
| Custodian witnessed taking |
| OR custodian killed/unconscious |

> [!TIP] **Plain Dumb Down:** Someone threatens your cashier and takes the money = robbery. Someone breaks in at night when no one is there = burglary.

---

### 3. Theft Insurance (Broadest)

| Coverage |
|----------|
| Taking without owner's consent |
| No restriction on force/witness |
| Broad form covers theft of stock/equipment |
| Money & securities must be ADDED |

### Money & Securities Coverage
| Covered |
|---------|
| Destruction by fire |
| Disappearance (not attributable to theft) |
| Wrongful abstraction (unlawful taking) |

---

## 📉 Business Interruption Insurance (33:43 - 38:03)

> 💡 **From Transcript (2023s):** Restores lost income if business damaged by insured peril.

| Business Interruption |
|----------------------|
| Attached to commercial property policy |
| Same perils as property policy |
| Coverage: date of loss → up to 12 months |
| Pays even PAST policy expiry |

> [!TIP] **Plain Dumb Down:** Fire destroys your factory. You can't work for 6 months. This insurance pays your lost profits and ongoing expenses (rent, salaries, mortgage) while you rebuild.

---

### What It Pays

| Coverage |
|----------|
| Lost net profits |
| Continuing expenses (salaries, taxes, mortgage, rent) |
| Extra expenses to reduce loss (if you can prove it) |

### 📋 Example: Restaurant Trailer
> Your restaurant burns down. You set up a food trailer outside. You can prove this reduces lost income. Insurance pays for the trailer setup.

---

### Three Types of BI Insurance

| Type | Pays Until | Best For |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Gross Earnings** | Property repaired OR 12 months | Most businesses |
| **Profits Form** | Income restored OR 12 months | Businesses that lose long-term customers |
| **Extra Expenses** | N/A (pays extra costs only) | Businesses that can resume quickly |

---

### 1. Gross Earnings Form
> Pays until property repaired OR 12 months (whichever first).

---

### 2. Profits Form (More Expensive)
> Pays until income RESTORED OR 12 months.

### 📋 Example: Newspaper/Dry Cleaner
> 💡 **From Transcript (2150s):** By being out of business for months, you lose long-term customers. Profits form gives more time to re-acquire customers.

> [!TIP] **Plain Dumb Down:** Your building is fixed in 3 months, but customers went to competitors. Gross Earnings stops at 3 months. Profits Form keeps paying until your revenue is back to normal.

---

### 3. Extra Expenses Insurance

| Coverage |
|----------|
| Extra expenses to maintain normal business |
| NO need to prove it reduces loss |
| For businesses that resume QUICKLY |

### 📋 Examples: Who Uses This?
| Business Type | Why |
|---------------|-----|
| Insurance brokers | Just need laptop + phone |
| Travel agents | Work from anywhere |
| Doctors | Find temporary office |
| Banks | Must stay operational |
| Lawyers | Work remotely |

### Examples of Covered Expenses
- Renting temporary premises
- Renting temporary equipment
- Overtime salaries to rebuild faster

---

### Key Points

| Point |
|-------|
| BI is NOT standalone—added via endorsement |
| Same perils as property policy |
| If property policy excludes earthquake, BI excludes earthquake too |
