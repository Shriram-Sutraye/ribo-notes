> **Timestamp:** 640.242s - 847.895s (10:40 - 14:08) | **Chapter 09 - Part 6**

---

## 📋 LIMITED Business Coverage (640.242s - 707.539s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (640.242s-649.045s):** "The next category that is covered but on a limited basis is for business or business property. This type of liability is normally insured under your CGL."

> 💡 **From Transcript (649.525s-654.166s):** "Except for injury arising out of the following activities."

| Limited Business Coverage |
|--------------------------|
| Business liability = normally covered by **CGL** |
| BUT some activities ARE covered by home insurance |
| These are the EXCEPTIONS! |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Usually, anything "business-related" is NOT covered by your home insurance—you need commercial insurance (CGL). BUT there are some business-ish activities that ARE covered. Think of these as "gray areas" where personal life and business overlap.

---

### Exception 1: Personal Actions in Course of Business (654.166s - 665.529s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (654.166s-658.167s):** "First activity is personal actions of the insured in the course of business, but not directly related to business."

> 💡 **From Transcript (658.167s-665.529s):** "Examples include playing at a company sponsored golf tournament."

| Exception: Personal Actions at Work |
|-----------------------------------|
| Personal actions DURING business hours |
| BUT not directly related to the work itself |
| Example: **Company golf tournament** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You're at work, but doing something PERSONAL. Like playing golf at your company's tournament. If you hit someone with a golf ball, that's covered by your HOME insurance—not your company's CGL. Why? Because playing golf isn't "doing your job." It's personal fun that happens to be during a work event.

---

### Exception 2: Occasional Rental of Premises (665.529s - 672.49s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (665.529s-667.849s):** "The occasional rental of an insurance premises is also covered."

> 💡 **From Transcript (667.849s-672.49s):** "For example, if you rent your place while you're on vacation."

| Exception: Occasional Rental |
|-----------------------------|
| Rent your home OCCASIONALLY |
| Example: Vacation rental while you're away |
| **COVERED** under home insurance |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Going on vacation for 2 weeks? Renting your house on Airbnb? If a guest gets hurt while staying there, your HOME insurance covers the liability. This only works for OCCASIONAL rentals—not if you're running a full-time rental business.

---

### Exception 3: Multi-Family Residence Rental (672.49s - 678.892s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (672.49s-678.732s):** "the rental of units in a 2-3 family residence as long as the insured lives in one unit and there's no more than two people per unit."

| Exception: 2-3 Family Homes |
|----------------------------|
| 2-3 family residence |
| You LIVE in one unit |
| Max 2 tenants per unit |
| **COVERED** under home insurance |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Own a duplex or triplex? Live in one unit, rent out the others? As long as you're living there too and keeping tenant numbers low (max 2 per unit), your liability is covered by your HOME insurance. You're a "landlord" but it's still considered personal—not commercial.

---

### Exception 4: Occasional Office/Studio in Home (678.892s - 691.135s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (678.892s-685.614s):** "Rental of space in your residence to other people for occasional office, school or studio use is covered as well."

> 💡 **From Transcript (685.614s-691.135s):** "and so is the rental of up to three parking spaces."

| Exception: Home Office/Studio Rental |
|-------------------------------------|
| Rent space for: office, school, studio use |
| Must be OCCASIONAL |
| Also: Up to **3 parking spaces** |
| **COVERED** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Rent out your spare room to a photographer for occasional shoots? Let a tutor use your basement as a study space? Rent your driveway's parking spots? All covered! These are small-scale, occasional uses that don't cross into "commercial" territory.

---

### Exception 5: Part-Time Business of Young People (691.295s - 695.856s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (691.295s-695.856s):** "Also covered is the part-time business of someone under 21 years old."

| Exception: Under-21 Part-Time Business |
|---------------------------------------|
| Part-time business |
| Owner/operator is **under 21** |
| **COVERED** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your teenager runs a lawn-mowing business on weekends? Your college kid tutors neighborhood kids? Covered! The insurance industry recognizes that young people often do small entrepreneurial activities, and they're protected under their parents' home insurance.

---

### Exception 6: Trailers (695.856s - 707.539s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (695.856s-702.538s):** "And the last category is trailers. Trailers are only covered by your personal liability insurance when it's not attached to a registrable motor vehicle."

> 💡 **From Transcript (702.538s-707.539s):** "If it is attached, it would be the auto insurance that covers it."

| Exception: Trailers |
|--------------------|
| **NOT attached** to motor vehicle = Home insurance ✅ |
| **Attached** to motor vehicle = Auto insurance ✅ |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your trailer sitting in the driveway? Someone trips on it? Home insurance covers it.
> Your trailer hooked up to your truck on the road? Auto insurance covers it.
> 
> Think of it as: Parked = home. Moving = auto.

---

## ❌ THE COMPLETE EXCLUSIONS LIST (710.98s - 844.294s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (710.98s-716.582s):** "So now that we've talked about the coverages that you get under the liability insurance, let's talk about the exclusions."

### Exclusion 1: Business Activities (716.582s - 742.028s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (716.582s-725.384s):** "So the first are for any regular business activities or unauthorized business use of the premises. All liabilities arising out of that are excluded, including workers compensation."

> 💡 **From Transcript (725.384s-732.746s):** "For example, if you're operating a business like a catering kitchen or something out of your home. If there's any liability that arises from those business activities, that would not be covered."

> 💡 **From Transcript (732.746s-742.028s):** "You would need to purchase either a home-based business endorsement or a totally separate business insurance policy."

| ❌ Exclusion: Business Activities |
|---------------------------------|
| Regular business operations = NOT covered |
| Unauthorized business use of premises = NOT covered |
| Example: Catering kitchen at home |
| **Solution:** Buy home-based business endorsement OR separate business insurance |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Running a REAL business from home? Your home insurance WON'T cover business-related liabilities. If you cater weddings from your kitchen and give someone food poisoning, you're NOT covered. Get a home-based business endorsement or full commercial insurance.

---

### Exclusion 2: Professional Services (744.829s - 761.193s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (744.829s-755.952s):** "Also related to that are any professional services. Similar to that is also the exclusion for professional services. So any liability arising out of rendering or failing to render proper professional services is not covered under this policy."

> 💡 **From Transcript (755.952s - 761.193s):** "You would need to get a separate professional liability or business insurance policy to cover that."

| ❌ Exclusion: Professional Services |
|-----------------------------------|
| Liability from professional advice = NOT covered |
| Failing to provide proper service = NOT covered |
| **Solution:** Professional liability insurance (E&O) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Are you a doctor, lawyer, accountant, or consultant? If you give bad advice (or fail to give advice you should have), your HOME insurance won't help. You need separate professional liability insurance (also called Errors & Omissions or Malpractice insurance).

---

### Exclusion 3: Intentional Damage/Criminal Acts (762.273s - 775.557s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (762.273s-769.155s):** "Also not covered is any intentional damage or criminal acts by or directed by the insured."

> 💡 **From Transcript (769.155s-775.557s):** "Of course, anything you do intentionally is not covered. This is only meant to cover accidents."

| ❌ Exclusion: Intentional/Criminal |
|----------------------------------|
| Intentional damage = NOT covered |
| Criminal acts = NOT covered |
| Only ACCIDENTS are covered |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You can't deliberately hurt someone and expect insurance to pay. That's not what insurance is for! Insurance covers ACCIDENTS—not crimes or intentional acts. If you punch your neighbor on purpose, you're paying out of pocket.

---

### Exclusion 4: Abuse & Corporal Punishment (775.797s - 780.518s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (775.797s-780.518s):** "Also not covered is actual or failing to prevent abuse or corporal punishment."

| ❌ Exclusion: Abuse/Punishment |
|------------------------------|
| Abuse = NOT covered |
| Corporal punishment = NOT covered |
| Failing to prevent = NOT covered |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Any form of abuse—physical, emotional, child abuse, elder abuse—is NEVER covered. Also, "corporal punishment" (like spanking that goes too far) is not covered. Insurance won't protect abusers.

---

### Exclusion 5: Transmission of Disease (780.518s - 785.479s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (780.518s-785.479s):** "transmission of disease by the insured, for example HIV, AIDS."

| ❌ Exclusion: Disease Transmission |
|----------------------------------|
| Knowingly transmitting disease = NOT covered |
| Examples: HIV, AIDS |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> If you knowingly transmit a disease to someone, that's not an "accident." It's intentional harm. Insurance won't cover lawsuits from that.

---

### Exclusion 6: Aircraft & Airport (785.599s - 794.441s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (785.599s-791.921s):** "ownership or use of aircraft or airport and all related activities. Anything that's airport or aircraft related, you need separate insurance for."

| ❌ Exclusion: Aircraft/Airport |
|------------------------------|
| Own an aircraft = NOT covered |
| Use an airport = NOT covered |
| All related activities = NOT covered |
| **Need:** Aviation insurance |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Have a private plane? Own a drone business? Run an airport? NONE of that is covered by home insurance. Aviation is a specialized world with specialized risks—and specialized insurance.

---

### Exclusion 7: War & Invasion (794.681s - 799.563s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (794.681s-799.563s):** "Also a standard exclusion is anything for war, invasion, rebellion, act of a foreign enemy, anything of that nature."

| ❌ Exclusion: War/Terrorism |
|---------------------------|
| War = NOT covered |
| Invasion = NOT covered |
| Rebellion = NOT covered |
| Foreign enemy acts = NOT covered |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Standard insurance exclusion worldwide: Acts of war are too massive and unpredictable for private insurance. If there's an invasion or rebellion, insurance companies can't cover everyone—they'd go bankrupt.

---

### Exclusion 8: Nuclear Liability (799.563s - 807.005s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (799.563s-807.005s):** "Also, any losses required to be insured under a nuclear energy liability policy is excluded here."

| ❌ Exclusion: Nuclear |
|---------------------|
| Nuclear-related losses = NOT covered |
| Requires special nuclear liability policy |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Nuclear incidents are so catastrophic they have their own special insurance system. Your home insurance won't touch nuclear liability.

---

### Exclusion 9: Watercraft/Vehicles/Trailers (Beyond Limits) (807.005s - 817.647s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (807.005s-817.647s):** "And then similar to the aircraft, any liability from watercraft, motorized vehicle or trailer except as stated above because you do have some coverage for watercraft as we've discussed would be excluded here."

| ❌ Exclusion: Watercraft etc. (Beyond Limits) |
|---------------------------------------------|
| Watercraft exceeding limits = NOT covered |
| Vehicles exceeding limits = NOT covered |
| (Except the limited coverage we discussed) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> We covered the small stuff (boats under 8m, vehicles under 25HP). Anything BIGGER than those limits? NOT covered. You need standalone boat/vehicle insurance.

---

### Exclusion 10: Terrorism (818.207s - 822.208s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (818.207s-822.208s):** "Also any actions of terrorism or counter-terrorism."

| ❌ Exclusion: Terrorism |
|-----------------------|
| Terrorism = NOT covered |
| Counter-terrorism = NOT covered |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Like war, terrorism is too big and unpredictable for regular insurance. Separate terrorism insurance exists for high-risk properties.

---

### Exclusion 11: Data Exclusion (822.208s - 828.53s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (822.208s-825.809s):** "There's a data exclusion as well, which is the same as in homeowners comprehensive, which we've discussed previously."

| ❌ Exclusion: Data/Cyber |
|------------------------|
| Data-related losses = NOT covered |
| Same as homeowners property exclusion |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Hackers, data breaches, cyber attacks—not covered by home insurance. You'd need separate cyber liability insurance.

---

### Exclusion 12: Asbestos, Fungi, Rot, Corrosion (828.53s - 835.252s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (828.53s-835.252s):** "Any asbestos, corrosion, fungi or rot."

| ❌ Exclusion: Hazardous Materials |
|--------------------------------|
| Asbestos = NOT covered |
| Corrosion = NOT covered |
| Fungi/Mold = NOT covered |
| Rot = NOT covered |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> These are long-term, predictable problems—not accidents. Insurance won't cover gradual deterioration or hazardous materials that should've been removed/prevented.

---

### Exclusion 13: Marijuana/Controlled Substances (833.251s - 844.294s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (833.251s-837.412s):** "or any structures or property that's used for marijuana production or production of other controlled substances."

> 💡 **From Transcript (837.412s-844.294s):** "Of course, now that marijuana is legal in Canada, there are endorsements that exist to allow you to grow a certain number of plants at home."

| ❌ Exclusion: Drug Production |
|-----------------------------|
| Marijuana production = NOT covered (by default) |
| Other controlled substances = NOT covered |
| **Exception:** Legal cannabis endorsement available! |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Growing weed? By default, NOT covered. But since cannabis is legal in Canada, you CAN buy an endorsement that allows you to grow the legal limit of plants at home (usually 4 plants). Without that endorsement, any liability from your cannabis plants is on you.
