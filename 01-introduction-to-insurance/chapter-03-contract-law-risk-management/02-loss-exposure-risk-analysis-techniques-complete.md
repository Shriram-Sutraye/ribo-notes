## 🎯 The Big Picture

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Now that you know how to identify risks, you need to CATEGORIZE them, ANALYZE how bad they could be, and then CHOOSE the right method to manage them. This section teaches you 7 different ways to handle risk - and insurance is just ONE of them!

---

## 📦 Part 1: Four Categories of Loss Exposure

> 💡 **From Transcript (536s-565s):** "Now when we look at loss exposures, we put them into 4 categories. The first is physical property. So that refers to buildings equipment as well as some intangibles related to building and equipment such as lease agreements. The second thing we look at is loss of use or loss of income. Third is legal liability. Are we going to get sued or have claims against us for alleged wrongdoings? And finally, the human assets, personal health and earnings capacity."

### The 4 Categories:

| # | Category | What It Includes |
|---|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | **Physical Property** | Buildings, equipment, lease agreements |
| 2 | **Loss of Use/Income** | Business interruption, lost revenue |
| 3 | **Legal Liability** | Lawsuits, claims for wrongdoing |
| 4 | **Human Assets** | Health, earnings capacity of personnel |

---

### 📋 Transcript Example: Human Assets

> 💡 **From Transcript (565s):** "For example, you might lose that due to disability, resignation or employee retirement."

| Human Asset Loss | Impact |
|------------------|--------|
| Disability | Key person can't work |
| Resignation | Talent leaves |
| Retirement | Experienced person gone |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If your star salesperson quits, gets hurt, or retires - that's a loss of a HUMAN asset. It can hurt the business just as much as a fire!

---

## 🔍 Part 2: What to Investigate

> 💡 **From Transcript (571s-622s):** "When we investigate, what do we look at? We want to look at the loss history. What claims were there in the past?"

### 4 Areas to Investigate:

| Area | What to Check |
|------|---------------|
| **1. Loss History** | Past claims |
| **2. Physical Characteristics** | Size, construction, occupancy, neighborhood |
| **3. Protection** | Hydrant, sprinklers, alarms, guards, safety equipment |
| **4. Liability Factors** | Contracts, bylaws, uninsured parties, product liability |

---

### Investigation: Physical Characteristics

> 💡 **From Transcript (579s-592s):** "We also want to look at physical characteristics of the buildings and structures in place. What are their size? Where are their construction? Occupancy. What's in the going on in the neighborhood? These are all things you want to look at."

| Characteristic | Example Questions |
|----------------|-------------------|
| **Size** | How big is the building? |
| **Construction** | What's it made of? (wood, brick, steel) |
| **Occupancy** | What's it used for? |
| **Neighborhood** | What's going on around it? |

---

### Investigation: Protection

> 💡 **From Transcript (592s-606s):** "Next is protection. For example, what's your proximity to a fire hydrant? Are there sprinklers on the premises? Alarms? Security guards? Do you have any safety equipment?"

| Protection Factor | Example |
|-------------------|---------|
| **Fire hydrant** | How close? |
| **Sprinklers** | Installed? |
| **Alarms** | Fire? Burglar? |
| **Security guards** | On-site? |
| **Safety equipment** | Available? |

---

### Investigation: Liability Factors

> 💡 **From Transcript (606s-624s):** "And finally, what are some factors that might contribute to liability? For example, do you have any contractual obligations? Any bylaws that apply to you? Any losses caused by under or uninsured parties? Are there any products or completed operations liabilities?"

| Liability Factor | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Contractual obligations** | What contracts require of you |
| **Bylaws** | Local regulations |
| **Uninsured parties** | Others without coverage causing loss |
| **Product liability** | Claims from products sold |
| **Completed operations** | Claims from work done |

---

## 🏠 Part 3: Types of Property Exposed to Loss

> 💡 **From Transcript (624s-670s):** "Next, we want to look at the types of property that could be exposed to loss."

### 5 Types of Property:

| # | Type | Examples |
|---|------|----------|
| 1 | **Tangible** | Land, buildings, personal property |
| 2 | **Intangible** | Copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, contracts |
| 3 | **Net Income** | Revenue losses, expense increases |
| 4 | **Key Personnel** | Death, injury of important employees |
| 5 | **Liability Exposures** | Workers comp, premises, product liability |

---

### Perils: Natural, Human, Economic

> 💡 **From Transcript (669s):** "The perils that we're exposed to could be natural, human or economic."

| Peril Type | Examples |
|------------|----------|
| **Natural** | Earthquake, flood, fire |
| **Human** | Theft, vandalism, arson |
| **Economic** | Market crash, recession |

---

## 📊 Part 4: Step 2 - Risk Analysis

> 💡 **From Transcript (677s-688s):** "So in this first step, we have identified all of our different loss exposures. Step 2 is now to perform risk analysis, meaning to determine the financial consequences of a loss."

### What is Risk Analysis?

| Purpose |
|---------|
| Determine the **financial consequences** of a loss |
| Calculate based on **frequency** and **severity** |

---

### Loss Frequency

> 💡 **From Transcript (696s-726s):** "So when it comes to loss frequency, we look at the likelihood of an event occurring. So this is related to the law of large numbers, which says that the greater our sample size, the more certainty that we have."

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Loss Frequency** | How OFTEN a loss occurs |
| **Law of Large Numbers** | Bigger sample = more accurate prediction |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Coin Flip

> 💡 **From Transcript (708s-726s):** "For example, if you flip a coin twice, you might get two heads and come to the conclusion that when I flip a coin, it's 100% heads. If you flip a coin a million times, you're going to get closer and closer to a 50-50 split between heads and tails. So the larger our sample size, the more accurate our prediction is going to be."

| Sample Size | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| Flip 2 times | Might get 100% heads (inaccurate!) |
| Flip 1 million times | Close to 50/50 (accurate!) |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** This is why insurance companies need LOTS of data. Flip a coin twice and you might think it always lands on heads. Flip it a million times and you'll see it's really 50/50.

---

### Loss Severity

> 💡 **From Transcript (726s-737s):** "The second thing we look at is loss severity, meaning this seriousness of the loss, meaning the cost of the loss. What would happen financially if that loss were to occur?"

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Loss Severity** | How BAD the loss is (cost) |
| **Question** | What's the financial impact? |

---

### Inverse Relationship (KEY CONCEPT!)

> 💡 **From Transcript (737s-769s):** "Usually, unfortunately, loss frequency and severity have an inverse relationship, meaning losses that are high in frequency are usually low in severity. Whereas losses that are low in frequency are typically high in severity."

| Relationship |
|--------------|
| **High Frequency = Low Severity** |
| **Low Frequency = High Severity** |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Shoplifting vs Earthquake

> 💡 **From Transcript (752s-769s):** "A common example would be shoplifting. It's high frequency, but it's low severity. People don't usually steal that much stuff at once. Conversely, earthquake is high severity, but low frequency. If an earthquake happens, it's very serious, but it doesn't happen very often."

| Event | Frequency | Severity |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Shoplifting** | High (happens often) | Low (small losses) |
| **Earthquake** | Low (rare) | High (devastating) |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Things that happen ALL THE TIME (shoplifting) usually aren't that expensive. Things that are RARE (earthquakes) are usually catastrophic.

---

### Financial Impact Formula

> 💡 **From Transcript (769s-780s):** "Then we want to assess the financial impact of a loss over time, and we would do that by taking the loss frequency and multiply that by the cost of the loss or the loss severity."

| Formula |
|---------|
| **Financial Impact = Frequency × Severity** |

```
EXAMPLE:
Shoplifting:
- Frequency: 100 times/year
- Severity: $50 each
- Impact: 100 × $50 = $5,000/year

Earthquake:
- Frequency: Once every 50 years
- Severity: $1,000,000
- Impact: 1/50 × $1,000,000 = $20,000/year expected cost
```

---

### Loss Mitigation

> 💡 **From Transcript (780s-799s):** "When it comes to loss mitigation, that refers to the steps that we take to prevent further loss. So we would assess the exposures, assess their seriousness, and then introduce mitigation strategies that the insured must comply with in order to reduce their loss or their risk."

| What is Mitigation? |
|--------------------|
| Steps to **prevent further loss** |
| Strategies the insured must comply with |

---

## 🎯 Part 5: Step 3 - Select & Implement Risk Management Techniques

> 💡 **From Transcript (799s-821s):** "So the third step in the risk management process is to select and implement the chosen risk management technique. The role of the broker in this case is to recommend insurance, as well as other alternative strategies and techniques to help your clients manage risk. This is a value added service that we provide where we explain, we recommend and we help them implement the various loss prevention measures."

### Broker's Role:

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Recommend insurance** | Primary role |
| **Recommend alternatives** | Value-added service! |
| **Explain** | Help clients understand |
| **Implement** | Help put measures in place |

---

### 📋 Transcript Example: Hot Tar Roofing

> 💡 **From Transcript (826s-855s):** "For example, if you have a client that's involved in hot tar roofing or any torch on roofing, the liability policy might require that they clear the area around where they're doing the hot tar roofing or the torching, and also that they stay on site for a few hours afterwards to make sure that there's no embers or fires that start. So this is an example of a risk management technique outside of insurance that you can recommend, but is also often required by some insurance policies."

| Hot Tar Roofing Requirements |
|-----------------------------|
| Clear the area before work |
| Stay on site for a few hours afterwards |
| Check for embers or fires |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** The insurance company says "if you want us to cover you, you have to follow these safety rules." Good brokers recommend these even if not required!

---

## 🛡️ Part 6: 7 Methods to Manage Risk

> 💡 **From Transcript (855s):** "So what are some different methods that we have to manage risk?"

### Overview of 7 Methods:

| # | Method | Definition |
|---|--------|------------|
| 1 | **Control** | Reduce impact when loss happens |
| 2 | **Avoid** | Don't do the risky activity |
| 3 | **Retain** | Accept and pay for it yourself |
| 4 | **Transfer** | Pass risk to someone else (insurance!) |
| 5 | **Reduce** | Lessen severity |
| 6 | **Prevent** | Stop loss from happening |
| 7 | **Diversify** | Spread risk across locations |

---

### 1️⃣ Control

> 💡 **From Transcript (855s-865s):** "The first is to control the risk. For example, a fire extinguisher would be a good example of risk control."

| Method | Control |
|--------|---------|
| **Definition** | Reduce the impact when loss happens |
| **Example** | Fire extinguisher |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** You can't stop ALL fires, but a fire extinguisher CONTROLS the damage.

---

### 2️⃣ Avoid

> 💡 **From Transcript (865s-902s):** "The second way is to avoid. We just avoid doing that activity altogether. This is not very practical because some risks are hard to avoid."

| Method | Avoid |
|--------|-------|
| **Definition** | Don't do the risky activity at all |
| **Practical?** | Often NOT practical |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Pizza Shop Delivery

> 💡 **From Transcript (874s-894s):** "For example, if you open a pizza shop and you don't want the risk of hitting somebody with a car while on a delivery, you can just not do deliveries or outsourced them to a third party like Uber Eats or DoorDash. However, this may not be feasible or practical for a lot of businesses. It would be very challenging to run a pizza shop and you don't do delivery."

| Scenario | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Pizza shop + delivery risk | Avoid: No deliveries at all |
| **Alternative** | Outsource to Uber Eats/DoorDash |
| **Practical?** | Hard to run pizza shop with no delivery |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Earthquake

> 💡 **From Transcript (894s-902s):** "Or there are certain risks that are unavoidable like the risk of an earthquake. There's nothing you can do to avoid the risk of an earthquake happening."

| Unavoidable Risks |
|-------------------|
| Earthquake - can't stop it from happening |

---

### 3️⃣ Retain

> 💡 **From Transcript (902s-930s):** "The third method is to retain. This means retaining the risk and paying for it out of pocket. This would be a useful technique if the risk is uninsurable or if the organization is okay with the financial consequences of the risk."

| Method | Retain |
|--------|--------|
| **Definition** | Accept the risk, pay out of pocket |
| **When to use** | Risk is uninsurable OR acceptable |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Shoplifting

> 💡 **From Transcript (918s-930s):** "For example, the risk of shoplifting. In most cases, you are not going to file an insurance claim for shoplifting. You're most likely just going to absorb the risk yourself and pay for it out of pocket. Just take the loss, basically."

| Scenario | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Shoplifting | Just take the loss |
| **Why?** | Too small to file claims |
| **Method** | Retain - pay out of pocket |

---

### 4️⃣ Transfer

> 💡 **From Transcript (930s-945s):** "The fourth method you can use is transfer, meaning to transfer the financial consequence of the risk to another person. Most commonly you do this by buying insurance or with certain contractual agreements like a hold harmless clause or an indemnity agreement."

| Method | Transfer |
|--------|----------|
| **Definition** | Pass risk to someone else |
| **Main way** | Buy INSURANCE |
| **Other ways** | Hold harmless clause, indemnity agreement |
| **Used in** | Commercial contracts, lease agreements |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** This is what insurance brokers do most! Transfer the client's risk to the insurance company.

---

### 5️⃣ Reduce

> 💡 **From Transcript (945s-965s):** "The next thing you can do is reduce, meaning you would engage in activities that lessen your lost severity. So for example, installing sprinklers. Sprinklers won't stop a fire from starting, but it will stop the fire from spreading and causing more damage."

| Method | Reduce |
|--------|--------|
| **Definition** | Lessen the SEVERITY of loss |
| **Key point** | Doesn't prevent, just limits damage |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Sprinklers

| Scenario | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Sprinklers installed | Won't STOP fire from starting |
| | WILL stop fire from spreading |
| **Method** | Reduce - limits damage |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Sprinklers don't prevent fires, but they REDUCE how bad the fire gets.

---

### 6️⃣ Prevent

> 💡 **From Transcript (966s-987s):** "Next we have prevention. Prevention stops a loss from happening altogether. For example, installing very prominently displayed security cameras or putting safety locks on your equipment. In this case, if a would be thief sees the security cameras and they see the locks, they might not even try to rob you in the first place. That's an example of prevention."

| Method | Prevent |
|--------|---------|
| **Definition** | Stop the loss from happening at ALL |
| **Key point** | Different from reduce - actually prevents! |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Security Cameras & Locks

| Scenario | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Security cameras prominently displayed | Thief sees them |
| Safety locks on equipment | Thief sees them |
| **Result** | Thief doesn't even TRY to rob you |
| **Method** | Prevention - stops loss before it happens |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** The VISIBLE cameras and locks PREVENT the robbery from even being attempted. The thief walks away!

---

### 7️⃣ Diversify

> 💡 **From Transcript (987s-1013s):** "And finally, we have diversify. We can reduce the concentration and the chances or the impact of a loss by spreading things out. For example, you might keep a spare key in another place. Or if you're a manufacturing facility, you might want to have multiple facilities in different countries or different provinces, so that an earthquake or a natural disaster in one area doesn't impact your overall operations too much."

| Method | Diversify |
|--------|-----------|
| **Definition** | Spread risk across multiple locations |
| **Key point** | Don't put all eggs in one basket |

### 📋 Transcript Examples:

| Scenario | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Spare key | Keep in another place |
| Manufacturing | Multiple facilities in different provinces/countries |
| **Why?** | Earthquake in one area = others still operate |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If you have ONE factory and it burns down, you're done. If you have THREE factories in different cities, you lose one but keep going!
