## 🌾 Farm Insurance Overview (10:20 - 10:44)

> 💡 **From Transcript (610.68s-644.6s):** "Now let's talk about farm insurance. Farm insurance is interesting because it's a combination of both habitation and the commercial policies that we've discussed elsewhere in this course. So when it comes to the actual dwelling that you live in, as well as the personal property coverage and endorsements, those are the same as the habitation forms. When it comes to farm liability, it's also a mixture of business and personal liability."

| Farm Insurance Overview |
|------------------------|
| COMBINATION of habitation + commercial |
| Dwelling coverage = same as homeowners |
| Personal property = same as homeowners |
| Farm liability = mix of business + personal |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> A farm is part HOME
> - The house you live in = covered like a homeowner's policy
> - Your personal stuff = covered like regular home insurance
> 
> But also part BUSINESS:
> - Your barn = commercial building
> - Your tractors = commercial equipment
> - Injured worker = business liability
> 
> Farm insurance is a COMBO policy!

### Limited Pollution Liability

> 💡 **From Transcript (641.08s-644.6s):** "If you need coverage for certain niche things like farmers limited pollution liability, that is available."

| Farmers Limited Pollution Liability |
|------------------------------------|
| Optional add-on coverage |
| For farm-specific pollution risks |
| e.g., pesticide runoff, manure spills |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Farms have unique pollution risks—pesticides, fertilizers, manure. Regular insurance doesn't cover this. Farmers can add Limited Pollution Liability to protect against environmental claims.

---

## 🏚️ Farm Buildings Coverage (10:50 - 11:18)

> 💡 **From Transcript (646.28s-667.959s):** "When it comes to farm buildings and contents coverage, the coverage that you purchase can range from just the fire policy, all the way up to all risk. We define farm buildings as things like barns, workshops, storage buildings, for machinery or granaries or any buildings or structures that are used for farming purposes. Of course commercial poll, of course the standard replacement cost coverage for commercial policies are available here as well."

| Farm Buildings |
|---------------|
| Coverage range: Fire only → All Risk |
| Includes: Barns, workshops, storage buildings |
| Includes: Machinery buildings, granaries |
| Includes: Any structure for farming purposes |
| Replacement cost available |

### Types of Farm Buildings

| Building | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Barns | Livestock, hay storage |
| Workshops | Equipment repairs |
| Storage buildings | Machinery storage |
| Granaries | Grain storage |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Any building used for FARMING is a "farm building"—barns, sheds, grain silos, machine shops. You can insure them on basic fire coverage or all-risk (full protection). Most farmers want replacement cost so they can rebuild at today's prices.

## 💰 Rebuilding Clause - Deferred Payment (11:18 - 11:53)

> 💡 **From Transcript (673.56s-704.76s):** "When it comes to ensuring farm buildings, there's also something special here called the rebuilding clause deferred payment. This applies to out buildings. Under this clause, you only get 50% of the amount to payable upfront and then the remaining 50% if the building has been repair or replaced within nine months of the loss and within 20 feet of the original structure and the building is being used for its original purpose for the same purpose. The reason for that is because oftentimes farms will have abandoned buildings and they want to make sure that you are actually replacing them before they give you the full replacement cost coverage."

| Rebuilding Clause - Deferred Payment |
|------------------------------------|
| Applies to: OUTBUILDINGS (not main dwelling) |
| **50% paid upfront** |
| **50% paid AFTER** if conditions met |

### Conditions for Remaining 50%

| Condition | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Rebuilt within | **9 months** of loss |
| Location | Within **20 feet** of original |
| Purpose | **Same purpose** as before |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Abandoned Buildings

> 💡 **From Transcript (699.72s-704.76s):** "The reason for that is because oftentimes farms will have abandoned buildings and they want to make sure that you are actually replacing them before they give you the full replacement cost coverage."

| Why This Clause Exists |
|-----------------------|
| Farms often have OLD, ABANDONED buildings |
| Insurers don't want to pay full replacement for buildings farmers won't actually rebuild |
| Forces farmers to PROVE they'll rebuild |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your old barn worth $200,000 burns down. Insurance gives you:
> - **$100,000 immediately** (50%)
> - **$100,000 more** IF you rebuild within 9 months, near the old spot, and use it for the same purpose (storing hay, not as a garage)
> 
> This stops farmers from cashing out on abandoned barns they never planned to rebuild!

## 📏 Determining Rebuild Values (11:53 - 13:06)

> 💡 **From Transcript (710.36s-757.0s):** "So how would you determine rebuild values when it comes to farm buildings? There's a couple ways we can do it. The first is within insurance appraisal where a license appraisal will come and assess the property to provide an accurate rebuild value. This can be the most accurate but also is the most expensive."

### 4 Methods to Determine Rebuild Value

| Method | Description | Accuracy | Cost |
|--------|-------------|----------|------|
| 1. Insurance Appraisal | Licensed appraiser visits | **Most accurate** | **Most expensive** |
| 2. Contractor Estimates | Licensed builder estimates repairs | High | Medium |
| 3. Evaluator Software | Industry software based on sqft, location | Good | Low |
| 4. Online Calculator | Basic estimate from sqft, features | Basic | Free/Low |

---

### Contractor Estimates

> 💡 **From Transcript (725.0s-735.959s):** "In other way to calculate rebuild values is through contractor estimates. So you can use a license builder or contractor to estimate the repair costs."

| Contractor Estimates |
|---------------------|
| Get a licensed builder |
| They estimate repair/rebuild costs |
| Less expensive than formal appraisal |

---

### Evaluator Software

> 💡 **From Transcript (735.959s-757.0s):** "And the last common way to do it is do an evaluator software. So this is specialized software that we use in the insurance industry and I'm sure other industries as well which will provide a rebuild cost estimate based on the square footage, location and features. The one downside of using this method is it may miss some special features or special scenarios that may apply to your building."

| Evaluator Software |
|-------------------|
| Industry-specific software |
| Based on: Square footage, location, features |
| Downside: May miss special features |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You enter "barn, 5000 sqft, Ontario, wooden frame" into software. It spits out an estimate. BUT—if your barn has a custom ventilation system or historical features, the software might miss that!

---

### Calculating Rebuild Values - Steps

> 💡 **From Transcript (763.88s-811.08s):** "So when it comes to actually calculating rebuild values there's a couple steps we go through as the first step is to gather property details so obtain measurements and list out all the features. Next you want to research local construction costs because materials and labour costs can vary from region to region so you need to adjust. Then we use an estimation tool or an estimation service like a software some kind of calculator or hiring a professional appraisal to actually go and estimate the values. And then we made it to adjust for additional factors like building codes that you might have to account for when you're rebuilding, additional structures, or even inflation. And finally we want to make sure we review and we update these values regularly. At least annually if there's any significant changes to the property and then adjust the policy accordingly to make sure our clients are not under insured."

| 5 Steps to Calculate Rebuild Value |
|-----------------------------------|
| 1. **Gather details** - measurements, features |
| 2. **Research local costs** - materials, labour vary by region |
| 3. **Use estimation tool** - software, calculator, or hire appraiser |
| 4. **Adjust for factors** - building codes, extra structures, inflation |
| 5. **Review regularly** - at least annually, update policy |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> 1. Measure your barn (2000 sqft, brick, 20 stalls)
> 2. Check what construction costs in YOUR area (Ontario vs Alberta differs!)
> 3. Use software or hire an appraiser
> 4. Add for new building codes, inflation, extras
> 5. Review EVERY YEAR—construction costs go up!

## 📦 Farm Contents (13:27 - 13:48)

> 💡 **From Transcript (817.0s-828.12s):** "So that's farm buildings. When it comes to farm contents this can be done on a blanket or scheduled coverage basis. Scheduled coverage is typically recommended for high value items like welders or very specialized pieces of machinery."

| Farm Contents Coverage |
|-----------------------|
| **Blanket** = all contents together |
| **Scheduled** = list each item separately |
| Scheduled recommended for: |
| - High-value items (welders) |
| - Specialized machinery |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> - **Blanket:** "We have $100,000 of stuff in the barn"
> - **Scheduled:** "We have a $30,000 tractor, a $15,000 welder, a $10,000 combine..."
> 
> For expensive, specialized equipment, SCHEDULE them individually so there's no dispute on value!

---

## 🚜 Farm Machinery & Equipment (13:55 - 14:45)

> 💡 **From Transcript (835.24s-865.88s):** "And that brings us to farm machinery and equipment. Under this coverage it ensures all tools and equipment that are usual to a farming business. Of course it excludes any vehicles that are subject to registration like trucks and cars that are driven on the public roadways. Coverage here similar to farm contents can be on a schedule or blanket basis. You can choose to ensure them on a named perils or all risk basis. And it can include automatic coverage for any newly acquired equipment and of course non-owned equipment that you lease similar to the traditional commercial property equipment coverage."

| Farm Machinery & Equipment |
|---------------------------|
| Covers: All tools/equipment usual to farming |
| Excludes: Registered vehicles (cars, trucks) |
| Scheduled or blanket basis |
| Named perils or all-risk |
| Automatic coverage for new equipment |
| Covers leased/non-owned equipment |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Tractors, combines, hay balers, plows—all covered! But NOT your pickup truck (that goes on auto insurance). You can add new equipment automatically and even cover leased equipment.

---

## 🌿 Custom Farming (14:32 - 15:00)

> 💡 **From Transcript (872.12s-900.36s):** "There's also a concept here we need to know called custom farming. Custom farming in layman's firms is basically contract farming. So someone has paid you to use your machinery away from your farm to farm their land for compensation. If you have any equipment that's engaged in custom farming there are some exclusions that apply it. So all of the usual equipment exclusions but also electrical currents, mechanical breakdown, tires and tubes unless they're caused by certain perils. Property in or in transit to custom farming unless permission is given."

| Custom Farming |
|---------------|
| = Contract farming |
| Using YOUR machinery on SOMEONE ELSE'S land |
| For compensation (you get paid) |

### Custom Farming Exclusions

| Exclusion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Standard equipment exclusions | Normal exclusions apply |
| Electrical currents | Power surge damage |
| Mechanical breakdown | Equipment failure |
| Tires and tubes | Unless caused by covered peril |
| Property in transit | Unless permission given |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your neighbor pays you $5,000 to combine their wheat using YOUR combine. That's "custom farming." But watch out—while your equipment is working someone else's land:
> - Tire blowouts? NOT covered
> - Mechanical breakdown? NOT covered
> - Electrical damage? NOT covered
> 
> These are EXTRA risky situations!

## 🐄 Farm Livestock (15:11 - 15:38)

> 💡 **From Transcript (900.36s-918.44s):** "Next is farm livestock. Farm livestock are ensured on a named perils basis subject to co-insurance. There's also a limit for theft and a limit for each animal that might apply."

| Farm Livestock |
|---------------|
| Coverage: Named perils basis |
| Subject to co-insurance |
| Limits for theft |
| Per-animal limits may apply |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Cows, pigs, chickens, horses—insured against specific named perils (fire, lightning, etc.). Co-insurance applies (80% rule). There might be limits like:
> - Max $5,000 for any one animal
> - Max $25,000 for theft of livestock

---

## 🌽 Farm Produce (15:25 - 15:53)

> 💡 **From Transcript (919.72s-953.56s):** "Next you have farm produce. Farm produce means the stuff that's listed on the dec page depending on what type of farm you operate, including feed, fertilizers, pesticides, milk, eggs, and other agricultural products. Coverage is named perils or all risk and because it's a commercial policy will be subject to co-insurance."

| Farm Produce |
|-------------|
| Listed on declarations page |
| Includes: Feed, fertilizers, pesticides |
| Includes: Milk, eggs, agricultural products |
| Named perils OR all-risk |
| Subject to co-insurance |

---

### What's NOT Covered (Unless Extended)

> 💡 **From Transcript (946.04s-965.079s):** "However, tobacco, flacks, lumber or standing meaning unharvested crops are not covered. You can get an extension for standing crops. Usually the limit is set on a per acre basis, refrigerated crops or damage caused by extremes in temperature. So it's not covered but you can get coverage for those separately through an endorsement or something like that."

| NOT Covered |
|------------|
| Tobacco |
| Flax |
| Lumber |
| **Standing (unharvested) crops** |
| Refrigerated crops (temp damage) |

| Can Be Extended |
|----------------|
| Standing crops endorsement (per acre) |
| Refrigerated crops endorsement |
| Temperature damage endorsement |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your harvested wheat in the barn = covered. Your wheat still growing in the field = NOT covered (unless you buy the extension). Same with your refrigerated milk—if the cooler fails and milk spoils, you need the temperature damage endorsement!

---

## 📋 Miscellaneous Farm Coverages (16:11 - 16:26)

> 💡 **From Transcript (966.839s-984.2s):** "You also have some miscellaneous coverage that you need to know about. So farm earnings which is basically business-interruption farms, you can get coverage for game or exotic livestock for embryo or for semen."

| Miscellaneous Farm Coverages |
|-----------------------------|
| **Farm Earnings** = Business interruption for farms |
| **Game/Exotic Livestock** = Non-standard animals |
| **Embryo coverage** |
| **Semen coverage** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> - **Farm Earnings:** Barn burns and you can't harvest for 6 months? Insurance pays your lost income.
> - **Exotic animals:** You raise ostriches or bison? Special coverage needed.
> - **Embryo/Semen:** Bull semen can be worth $100,000+. Yes, you can insure it!

---

## 📝 Farm Underwriting Requirements (16:24 - 16:46)

> 💡 **From Transcript (984.2s-1006.92s):** "And finally when it comes to underwriting farm policies, you must have a written application including a diagram of distances between buildings because a fire in one building can very easily spread to another if they are close together. If you have vacant property, buildings over a certain number of years old or buildings insured under replacement cost or open-sided structures that are insured against wind storm and hail would require pictures for underwriting purposes."

| Farm Underwriting Requirements |
|-------------------------------|
| Written application required |
| Diagram of building distances |
| (Fire can spread between close buildings) |

### Photos Required For:

| Situation | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Vacant property | Higher risk |
| Old buildings | Age matters |
| Replacement cost buildings | Value verification |
| Open-sided structures | Wind/hail risk |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Insurance companies want to see a MAP of your farm showing how far apart buildings are. If your barn is 5 feet from your house, one fire = both destroyed! They also want PHOTOS of old buildings, vacant buildings, and anything that might blow away in a storm.
