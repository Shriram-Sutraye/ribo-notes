# Initial Application Process & Application Types

> **Timestamp:** ~23:01 - 28:00 in the video

This section covers **how insurance gets purchased** - the step-by-step process from first contact to application, and the different types of applications used.

---

## 🎯 The Big Picture

> 🎯 **Plain English:** When someone wants to buy insurance, there's a formal process that happens. You don't just say "give me insurance" - there's a structured approach that protects both the customer AND the broker. This section explains what happens from the moment a customer calls until they have a policy.

---

## 📝 Part 1: Initial Application Process

### Overview

There are **4 key steps** in the initial application process:

```
Step 1: Greeted professionally by CSR
        ↓
Step 2: Conduct needs assessment
        ↓
Step 3: Identify insurer/products → Send application
        ↓
Step 4: Get client consent (express or implied) before proceeding
```

---

### Step 1️⃣: Greeted Professionally by CSR

> 💡 **From Screenshot:** "Greeted professional by CSR"

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **CSR** | Customer Service Representative |
| **Role** | First point of contact for clients |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** When a customer calls or walks in, they're greeted by a CSR (Customer Service Representative). This person is the "front desk" of the brokerage. They:
> - Answer initial questions
> - Handle policy changes
> - Review renewals
> - Update client files
> - Assist with billing
> - Cross-sell products
>
> **First impressions matter:** The CSR sets the tone for the entire client relationship.

---

### Step 2️⃣: Conduct Needs Assessment

> 💡 **From Screenshot:** "Conduct needs assessment"

**This is a MANDATORY requirement under RIBO's Code of Conduct!**

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **What** | Thorough evaluation of client's insurance needs |
| **When** | BEFORE recommending any insurance solution |
| **Why** | Ensure product recommendations are suitable |
| **Who** | All licensed insurance brokers in Ontario |

#### What Gets Assessed:

| Factor | Questions to Ask |
|--------|------------------|
| **Underlying Risk** | What are you trying to protect? Home? Car? Business? |
| **Client Objectives** | What's most important - price? Coverage? Convenience? |
| **Product Complexity** | Simple auto policy vs. complex commercial risk |
| **Current Coverage** | What do you have now? Any gaps? |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Before recommending ANYTHING, you must understand what the client actually NEEDS. This isn't just good practice - it's the LAW under RIBO rules.
>
> **Example:**
> - Client says: "I want the cheapest car insurance"
> - Wrong approach: "Here's our cheapest policy" ❌
> - Right approach: "Let me understand your situation first. Do you commute? Who else drives the car? What's your deductible tolerance?" ✅

#### Documentation Requirements:

> **Key Rule:** The client file MUST reflect:
> - Information collected from client
> - Your analysis of their needs
> - Available products considered
> - Rationale for your recommendation
>
> **Why?** So anyone can look at the file and understand WHY you made that recommendation.

#### Take-All-Comers (TAC) Rule (Auto Insurance):

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Offer lowest rate available** | Based on needs assessment |
| **Recommend most suitable coverage** | NOT just cheapest |
| **Advise on risks** | If client declines or reduces coverage |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** For auto insurance, you MUST offer the lowest rate, but also explain if the cheapest option might leave them underinsured. If they say "I don't want collision coverage," you need to warn them what that means.

---

### Step 3️⃣: Identify Insurer/Products → Send Application

> 💡 **From Screenshot:** "Identify insurer/products → send application"

| Action | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Identify Insurer** | Based on needs assessment, which company is best? |
| **Identify Products** | Which specific coverage/policy fits their needs? |
| **Send Application** | Submit to the insurer for underwriting |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Now you match the client's needs to the right solution:
>
> 1. **Which company?** - If they need flood coverage, which insurer offers it in their area?
> 2. **Which product?** - Basic vs. comprehensive? What riders/endorsements?
> 3. **Submit!** - Send the application to the insurance company for review and pricing

---

### Step 4️⃣: Get Client Consent (Express or Implied)

> 💡 **From Screenshot:** "Get client consent (express or implied) before proceeding"

**This is required under PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act)!**

#### Two Types of Consent:

| Type | Description | When Required |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Express Consent** | Clear, direct agreement (signature, checkbox) | Sensitive info (credit, health, financial) |
| **Implied Consent** | Assumed based on context | Non-sensitive, obvious uses |

> 🎯 **Plain English:**
>
> **Express Consent** = "I explicitly agree"
> - Signing a form
> - Checking a box
> - Saying "yes, I consent"
>
> **Implied Consent** = "It's obvious I agree"
> - If you're applying for car insurance, it's implied you consent to them checking your driving record
> - BUT for sensitive stuff (credit checks, health info), you need EXPRESS consent

#### What Makes Consent "Meaningful"?

| Requirement | What It Means |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Clear** | No legal jargon, plain language |
| **Specific** | Exactly what info, exactly why |
| **Informed** | Client understands consequences |
| **Voluntary** | Can withdraw anytime |

#### Sensitive Information (Express Consent Required):

- ✅ Credit reports/scores
- ✅ Health information
- ✅ Financial data
- ✅ Claims history
- ✅ Anything outside "reasonable expectations"

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If you're going to run a credit check, you CANNOT just assume it's okay. You must:
> 1. TELL the client you're doing it
> 2. Explain WHY you need it
> 3. Get their explicit "yes"

## 📋 Part 2: Application Types

There are **2 types** of insurance applications:

### 1️⃣ Oral Applications

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Method** | Over the phone, in person |
| **Speed** | Fast, convenient |
| **Documentation** | Must be well-documented by broker |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Customer calls, answers questions verbally, broker types it into the system. Quick and easy, BUT risky if not documented properly.

#### Challenges with Oral Applications:

| Risk | Issue |
|------|-------|
| **"He said/she said"** | Hard to prove what was discussed |
| **Miscommunication** | Client might misunderstand |
| **Missing info** | Easy to forget questions |

> ⚠️ **Key Rule:** If using oral consent/application, you MUST document:
> - WHO gave consent
> - WHEN it was given
> - HOW it was communicated
> - WHAT was agreed to

---

### 2️⃣ Written Applications

> 💡 **From Screenshot:** "Written - Benefits: 1. Accurate & checklist, 2. Recommendations & fewer errors, 3. Evidence of coverage, better service, & legal disclosures"

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Method** | Physical form, digital form, online portal |
| **Documentation** | Built-in paper trail |
| **Preferred by** | Most brokerages (reduces liability) |

#### 3 Key Benefits of Written Applications:

| Benefit | What It Means | Why It Matters |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **1. Accurate & Checklist** | Standardized form ensures all questions asked | Nothing gets missed |
| **2. Recommendations & Fewer Errors** | Forces structured approach | Reduces mistakes and omissions |
| **3. Evidence of Coverage, Better Service & Legal Disclosures** | Creates paper trail | Protects broker AND client if disputes arise |

> 🎯 **Plain English - Why Written is Better:**
>
> **Scenario:** Client has a claim denied because they didn't have flood coverage.
>
> | With Oral App | With Written App |
> |---------------|------------------|
> | Client: "They never asked about flood!" | You have signed form showing flood was offered and declined |
> | Broker: "I definitely asked!" | Clear evidence of what was discussed |
> | Result: He said/she said dispute | Case closed - documentation speaks |
>
> **The paper trail protects everyone.**

---

## 📊 Oral vs Written: Side-by-Side Comparison

| Feature | Oral Application | Written Application |
|---------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Speed** | ✅ Faster | ⏱️ Takes more time |
| **Convenience** | ✅ More convenient | 📝 Requires forms |
| **Documentation** | ⚠️ Must be manually created | ✅ Built-in |
| **Error Risk** | ⚠️ Higher | ✅ Lower (checklist) |
| **Legal Protection** | ⚠️ Weaker (hard to prove) | ✅ Stronger (paper trail) |
| **Client Review** | ❌ Can't review at own pace | ✅ Can review before signing |
| **Recommended?** | For simple follow-ups | ✅ For new business |

## 📋 Part 3: Key Application Info (9 Items!)

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Now we're going to talk about the types of information that might be generally required for an insurance application."

### The 9 Key Items You MUST Collect:

---

### 1️⃣ Named Insured & Mailing Address

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "We need the name of the named insured, which is the applicant. We also need their mailing address in case they need to receive policy documents or notices related to the insurance policy."

| Item | What to Collect |
|------|-----------------|
| **Named Insured** | Who is the applicant? Full legal name |
| **Mailing Address** | Where to send policy documents and notices |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Basic stuff - who are they and where do we send the paperwork?

---

### 2️⃣ Loss Payees (⚠️ Potential Moral Hazard!)

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "A loss payee is somebody other than the named insured who can collect money. If there's a lot of loss payees, you need to investigate because that could be a potential moral hazard."

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Loss Payee** | Someone OTHER than the insured who can collect on a claim |
| **Common Examples** | Banks, lenders, mortgage companies |

> ⚠️ **RED FLAG - Moral Hazard Warning:**

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "For example, if you have a lot of mortgages or debtors that are listed on the policy, maybe there's a lot of debt on there, which could indicate that insured might be suffering from financial difficulties, which means there's a higher risk of insurance fraud or neglecting the maintenance."

| Many Loss Payees Could Mean | Risk |
|-----------------------------|------|
| High debt load | Financial difficulties |
| Multiple mortgages | Possible distress |
| Many debtors | Higher fraud risk |
| Neglected maintenance | Claims more likely |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If someone has 5 different banks listed as loss payees, that's a sign they might be in financial trouble. Financially stressed people are more likely to:
> - Commit insurance fraud (arson, staged theft)
> - Neglect property maintenance (leading to claims)
>
> **Always investigate when you see multiple loss payees!**

---

### 3️⃣ Subject of Insurance

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "What are we insuring? Is it a home, car? Is it liability? Is it a piece of business equipment? What limit of insurance is required? What coverage is required?"

| For Property | For Auto |
|--------------|----------|
| What is it? (home, building, equipment) | Description of the automobile |
| Where is it? | Territory of operation |
| What limits? | Usage (business vs personal) |
| What's the usage? (living in it, rental, etc.) | Who drives it? |
| | Who has insurable interest? |

> 🎯 **Plain English:**
> - **Property:** What, where, how much, and how is it used?
> - **Auto:** What car, where driven, for what purpose, who drives, and who owns it?

---

### 4️⃣ Policy Term

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "When does the policy start? When does it end? Typically policies are for a one-year term."

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Inception Date** | When coverage starts |
| **Expiry Date** | When coverage ends |
| **Standard Term** | Usually 1 year |

> ⚠️ **Important Rule on Backdating:**

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "You can sometimes backdate the inception of the policy, but that requires some detailed investigation, because you cannot provide coverage for something that already happened. You cannot buy fire insurance on a house while it's on fire, or after it's already burned down."

> 🎯 **Plain English:** You CAN'T insure something that already happened. Period. If someone calls after their house burned down wanting "backdated" insurance, that's insurance fraud!

---

### 5️⃣ Loss History (≠ Claims History!)

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "You need to know the frequency and the types of losses, because this can be used to predict future losses. But just know that losses don't equal claims. You can have a loss, but not claim it."

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Loss** | Something bad happened (damage, accident) |
| **Claim** | You reported it to insurance for payment |
| **Key Difference** | You can have a loss without filing a claim |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** They're asking about LOSSES, not just claims. Someone might have had a small fender bender and paid out of pocket - that's still a loss even if they didn't claim it.

**Look-Back Periods:**

| Type | Typical Look-Back |
|------|-------------------|
| Home insurance | 3-5 years |
| Commercial insurance | 3-5 years |
| Auto insurance | 5-10 years |

---

### 6️⃣ Insurance History

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Who is your previous insurer? What was the policy number and what was the expiry date? This is used to confirm your loss history, check for any unexplained gaps in coverage, or any previous declines or refusals to insure or refusals to renew."

| What to Check | Why It Matters |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Previous insurer** | Verify loss history |
| **Policy number** | Cross-reference |
| **Expiry date** | Check for gaps |
| **Declines/non-renewals** | Red flags for underwriting |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If another company refused to insure them or didn't renew their policy, there's probably a reason. Find out why before you take them on!

---

### 7️⃣ Broker's Intermediary Report

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "As the broker, you know the client better than the underwriter at the insurance company does. So you can add some information based on your own personal knowledge."

| What You Know | How It Helps |
|---------------|--------------|
| Relationship with client | Shows you vouch for them |
| Site visits | You've seen the property |
| Character/responsibility | Personal knowledge |

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "This is very important for getting business approved that would otherwise not be. So if something is kind of on the edge of what the insurance company wants to take on, if you have photos or other supporting information to show that the facility is clean and well maintained, this might tip the scale and allow the insurance company to either give you a better rate or accept the risk when they otherwise would have declined it."

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Your personal seal of approval matters! If the underwriter is on the fence, YOUR report can make the difference between approved and declined.

---

### 8️⃣ Add Personal Insights/Observations

> 💡 **From Screenshot:** "Add personal insights or observations (e.g. property conditions)"

| What to Observe | Examples |
|-----------------|----------|
| Property condition | Clean, well-maintained, cluttered, overgrown |
| Safety measures | Smoke detectors, sprinklers, alarms |
| Maintenance | Up to date or neglected |
| Housekeeping | Organized or hazardous |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If you visit the property, take notes! "Property is well-maintained, smoke detectors present, clear egress paths" can help a borderline application get approved.

---

### 9️⃣ Include Photos/Risk Assessments for Complex Risks

> 💡 **From Screenshot:** "Include photos or risk assessments for complex risks (farms, biz)"

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Brokers will typically visit the property to assess the risk, especially if it's a complex risk like a manufacturing risk, to ensure that all insurance requirements are met. For example, if they're required to have sprinklers, alarm systems, the broker can go on site to make sure those risk management things have been implemented."

| Complex Risk Examples | What to Document |
|-----------------------|------------------|
| Farms | Buildings, livestock, equipment, operations |
| Manufacturing | Fire protection, machinery, hazards |
| Restaurants | Kitchen setup, fire suppression |
| Warehouses | Storage, sprinklers, loading areas |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** For complex commercial risks, PICTURES ARE WORTH THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. A photo showing their sprinkler system and fire alarm can be the difference between getting coverage and being declined.

---

---

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q1: Why is a needs assessment mandatory, not optional?

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Because RIBO's Code of Conduct requires it. More importantly, it protects YOU as the broker:
>
> - **Without needs assessment:** "Why did you sell them this policy? It doesn't fit their needs!" → You're liable
> - **With needs assessment:** "I assessed their needs. Here's my documented rationale." → You're protected

---

### Q2: What's the difference between express and implied consent?

| Type | How Given | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Express** | Direct, explicit agreement | "Yes, you can check my credit" |
| **Implied** | Assumed from actions/context | Applying for auto insurance implies consent to check driving record |

> 🎯 **Rule of thumb:** When in doubt, get EXPRESS consent. It's always safer.

---

### Q3: Can I use oral applications for everything?

**Technically yes, but it's risky.**

| Situation | Recommended Application Type |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| New business | ✅ Written |
| Policy changes | Either - document well |
| Simple renewals | Oral is okay IF documented |
| Anything involving consent | ✅ Written (safer) |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** The more documentation you have, the better protected you are. Oral is convenient but creates liability.

---

### Q4: What happens if I don't document oral consent properly?

**Potential consequences:**

- ❌ RIBO disciplinary action
- ❌ Errors & Omissions (E&O) claim against you
- ❌ Client disputes with no proof
- ❌ Privacy complaints (PIPEDA violation)

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If you can't prove what was said, you're in trouble. Always document.

---

### Q5: Why does written application provide "legal disclosures"?

Written forms typically include:

- ✅ Privacy policy
- ✅ Consent clauses
- ✅ Duty to disclose (material facts)
- ✅ Waiver of coverage options (if declined)
- ✅ Fee disclosures

> 🎯 **Plain English:** All the legal stuff that protects you gets built into the form. No need to remember to say it all - it's already there, and the client signs it.

---

### Q6: What is the Take-All-Comers (TAC) rule?

**For auto insurance in Ontario:**

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Must offer lowest rate** | Based on your needs assessment |
| **Must recommend suitable coverage** | Not just cheapest |
| **Must advise on decline risks** | If client reduces coverage |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** You can't refuse to quote someone auto insurance (hence "take all comers"). You must offer the best rate AND explain if they're underinsuring themselves.

---

### Q7: What does "evidence of coverage" mean as a benefit?

> 🎯 **Plain English:** A written application creates PROOF of:
>
> - What was applied for
> - What was offered
> - What was declined
> - When it happened
> - Who signed off
>
> **If there's ever a dispute:** This evidence can save your career.

---

### Q8: What are loss payees and why do multiple loss payees create moral hazard?

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Loss Payee** | Third party (not the insured) who can collect claim money |
| **Common Examples** | Banks, mortgage companies, finance companies |
| **Moral Hazard** | Increased risk of dishonest behavior |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If someone has MANY banks/lenders on their policy, it means they have lots of debt. High debt = financial stress = higher chance they might:
> - Commit fraud (arson, staged theft)
> - Neglect property maintenance
> - Let the property fall into disrepair
>
> **Always investigate when you see multiple loss payees!**

---

### Q9: What's the difference between loss history and claims history?

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Loss** | Something bad happened (damage, accident, fire) |
| **Claim** | You reported it and asked for payment |
| **Key Difference** | You can have a loss WITHOUT claiming it |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** 
> - You had a $500 fender bender but paid out of pocket → That's a LOSS but not a CLAIM
> - When insurers ask about "loss history" they want to know about ALL losses, even ones you didn't claim
>
> **Look-back periods:** Home/Commercial = 3-5 years, Auto = 5-10 years

---

## 🧠 Exam Tips

> [!TIP]
> **Memory Hooks:**
> - **Initial Process = GCIC:** Greet → Conduct needs assessment → Identify insurer/products → Consent
> - **Written App Benefits = ACE:** Accurate, Checklist → fewer errors → Evidence

### Key Points to Remember:

| Topic | Remember |
|-------|----------|
| **Needs Assessment** | MANDATORY under RIBO Code of Conduct |
| **Consent** | Express for sensitive, Implied for obvious |
| **TAC Rule** | Take All Comers - offer lowest rate, warn on gaps |
| **Written vs Oral** | Written = safer, better documentation |
| **SABS 2026** | July 1 - modular system, more consumer choice |
