## 🎯 The Big Picture

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Property insurance protects your STUFF (buildings, contents). This chapter teaches you what's covered, what's NOT covered, how deductibles work, what happens when you have a mortgage, and how the insurance company calculates your payout.

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (The Big Picture):**
> This is the "Rule Book" for property insurance. It tells you:
> - What kind of stuff can be covered.
> - What's automatically excluded.
> - How much YOU pay out of pocket (deductible).
> - How the bank (mortgagee) is protected.
> - How much money you actually GET when something bad happens.

## 📋 Part 1: Property Insured (Personal vs Commercial)

> 💡 **From Transcript (6.89s-29.70s):** "So first I want to talk about property insured. So personal property policies insure private non-business use property. Commercial property policies, as the name would imply, insure commercial use property at the named location."

### Two Types of Property Policies:

| Type | What It Covers |
|------|----------------|
| **Personal Property Policies** | Private, non-business use property |
| **Commercial Property Policies** | Commercial use property at named location |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Personal vs Commercial):**
> - **Personal**: Your HOUSE, your CAR, your STUFF. Things you use for everyday life, not work.
> - **Commercial**: Your BUSINESS. The store you own, the equipment inside, the inventory you sell.

---

## 🔒 Part 2: Coverage Types (Named Perils vs Broad Form)

> 💡 **From Transcript (31.12s-59.28s):** "So there's generally two types of coverage you can choose from. You can choose named perils or broad form. With named perils, it only insures against losses caused by perils listed on the policy. With broad form, it insures against all direct physical losses that are not specifically excluded on the policy."

### Two Coverage Options:

| Coverage Type | What It Means |
|---------------|---------------|
| **Named Perils** | ONLY covers perils listed on the policy |
| **Broad Form** | Covers ALL losses EXCEPT what's excluded |

> 💡 **From Transcript (48.87s-59.28s):** "So you can think of named perils and broad form as mirror opposites. One insures only the stuff that we list. Broad form insures everything that's not listed."

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Named Perils vs Broad Form):**
> - **Named Perils**: "We will pay for THESE things: Fire, Lightning, Theft..." If it's not on the list, too bad!
> - **Broad Form**: "We will pay for EVERYTHING... EXCEPT these things: Earthquake, War, Flood..." If it's not on the exclusion list, you're covered!
> 
> Think of Named Perils as a "Short Menu" (only a few options). Broad Form is an "All-You-Can-Eat Buffet MINUS a few items."

---

## 🔥 Part 3: Direct Damage vs Indirect Loss

> 💡 **From Transcript (61.24s-81.46s):** "The other characteristic of property insurance policies is that they insure direct damage only. So direct damage or direct loss is one where the insured property is damaged by the peril, for example fire damaging the building. An indirect loss is the result of a direct loss, such as lost income if your store was burnt down due to fire."

### Direct vs Indirect:

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Direct Damage** | Property damaged BY the peril | Fire damages the building |
| **Indirect Loss** | Result OF the direct loss | Lost income because store burned down |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Direct vs Indirect):**
> - **Direct**: The fire TOUCHED your building. The building is burned. That's direct.
> - **Indirect**: The fire burned your store, so you couldn't open for 3 months. You lost $50,000 in sales. That $50,000 is INDIRECT (the fire didn't touch the money, but you lost it because of the fire).
> 
> **Property insurance typically covers DIRECT damage only.** If you want indirect loss coverage (like lost income), you need a separate policy!

---

## 📍 Part 4: Location and Property Defined

> 💡 **From Transcript (83.78s-89.75s):** "The third characteristic is that only the property that's defined and the location that's defined on the policy are covered."

| Rule |
|------|
| **ONLY** property and location defined on the policy are covered |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Location Rule):**
> If your policy says "123 Main Street," your stuff at "456 Oak Avenue" is NOT covered. The policy is very specific about WHERE your stuff must be.

---

## ❌ Part 5: Exclusions (Perils & Property)

> 💡 **From Transcript (91.94s-147.91s):** "Exclusions. So there's two types of exclusions: we have perils excluded and property excluded."

### Two Types of Exclusions:

| Exclusion Type | What It Means |
|----------------|---------------|
| **Perils Excluded** | Certain EVENTS are not covered |
| **Property Excluded** | Certain ITEMS are not covered |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Two Types of Exclusions):**
> - **Peril Exclusion**: "We don't cover this EVENT." Example: "We don't cover earthquakes."
> - **Property Exclusion**: "We don't cover this THING." Example: "We don't cover your car under your home policy."

---

### 5a. Peril Exclusions (Why?)

> 💡 **From Transcript (97.14s-121.68s):** "With your peril exclusions, these are typically excluded because there is the potential for catastrophic loss. It's commercially uninsurable, meaning it's not profitable, or it's naturally occurring, or cumulative damage, or it's an uncommon loss. Examples would be nuclear incident, earthquake, wear and tear which is normal and cumulative, sewer backup, or war."

| Reason for Exclusion | Example |
|---------------------|---------|
| Catastrophic loss potential | Nuclear incident |
| Commercially uninsurable | War |
| Naturally occurring | Earthquake |
| Cumulative damage | Wear and tear |
| Uncommon loss | Sewer backup |

### 📋 Transcript Examples: Peril Exclusions

| Excluded Peril | Why |
|----------------|-----|
| **Nuclear incident** | Catastrophic |
| **Earthquake** | Catastrophic, naturally occurring |
| **Wear and tear** | Normal, cumulative |
| **Sewer backup** | Uncommon (but can be added) |
| **War** | Commercially uninsurable |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Peril Exclusions):**
> Insurance companies say: "These events are TOO BIG, TOO WEIRD, or TOO NORMAL for us to cover."
> - **Too Big**: Nuclear war, earthquake (would bankrupt the company).
> - **Too Normal**: Wear and tear (your roof getting old is NOT an "accident").
> - **Too Weird**: Sewer backup (but you CAN buy extra coverage for this).

---

### 5b. Property Exclusions (Why?)

> 💡 **From Transcript (121.68s-147.91s):** "Property exclusions can exist because there is a greater than normal loss potential. They might be expensive to insure or specialized forms already exist. Examples include automobiles, aircraft, vacant property, money or securities, or books of account. So, for example, your automobile would not be covered under your homeowners policy because a specialized form called automobile insurance already exists."

| Reason for Exclusion | Example |
|---------------------|---------|
| Greater than normal loss potential | Vacant property |
| Expensive to insure | Aircraft |
| Specialized forms exist | Automobiles |

### 📋 Transcript Examples: Property Exclusions

| Excluded Property | Why |
|-------------------|-----|
| **Automobiles** | Specialized auto insurance exists |
| **Aircraft** | Expensive, specialized coverage exists |
| **Vacant property** | High risk |
| **Money or securities** | High risk |
| **Books of account** | Specialized coverage exists |

> 💡 **From Transcript (140.50s-147.91s):** "So, for example, your automobile would not be covered under your homeowners policy because a specialized form called automobile insurance already exists."

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Property Exclusions):**
> - **Car**: "Get auto insurance for that."
> - **Plane**: "Get aviation insurance for that."
> - **Money in your safe**: "Too risky. Get a separate policy."
> - **Empty building**: "Too risky because no one's watching it."

## 💵 Part 6: The Deductible Clause

> 💡 **From Transcript (151.61s-194.03s):** "The second feature of property insurance policies is the deductible clause. A deductible is the amount that the insured is required to pay on every loss. Essentially, this is the amount the insured is required to absorb themselves. What it does is it helps eliminate small losses and keep insurance affordable for everyone."

### What is a Deductible?

| Deductible |
|------------|
| Amount insured pays on EVERY loss |
| Helps eliminate small claims |
| Keeps insurance affordable |
| Higher deductible = Lower premium |

---

### 📋 Transcript Example: $500 Deductible

> 💡 **From Transcript (171.13s-194.03s):** "Let's say for example you had a $500 deductible. If you had a $500 deductible, you would not make any claims for losses that are less than $500. It just wouldn't make sense. That means less claims paid out by the insurance company and less paperwork, which means cheaper insurance. The higher deductible you choose, the cheaper your premium will be, for exactly the same reason."

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| $500 deductible | Don't claim anything under $500 |
| Higher deductible | Cheaper premium |
| Fewer small claims | Less paperwork |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Deductible):**
> The deductible is YOUR portion. If you have a $500 deductible and $500 in damage, you get $0 from insurance. If you have $2,000 in damage, you pay the first $500, and insurance pays the other $1,500.
> 
> **Why does it exist?** If everyone claimed every $50 broken window, the insurance company would drown in paperwork and everyone's premiums would skyrocket. The deductible forces you to handle small stuff yourself.

---

## 🏦 Part 7: Standard Mortgage Clause

> 💡 **From Transcript (197.47s-248.88s):** "Now we move on to the standard mortgage clause. The standard mortgage clause is actually a side agreement between the insurance company and the mortgagee. And it guarantees 2 things."

### What is the Standard Mortgage Clause?

| Mortgage Clause |
|-----------------|
| Side agreement between insurer and mortgagee (bank) |
| 2 Guarantees |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Mortgage Clause Intro):**
> When you have a mortgage, the BANK has money on the line too. This clause is their "Safety Net" to make sure they don't get screwed if you do something stupid.

---

### 2 Guarantees:

> 💡 **From Transcript (207.87s-237.54s):** "The first thing is that it guarantees payment to the mortgagee when the insured is denied coverage due to breach of conditions. If the insured commits a misrepresentation, breach of warranty or fraud and is denied coverage, the mortgagee is still entitled to payment. The second guarantee is that the insurance company will not reduce coverage or terminate the policy without first notifying the mortgagee. They can also not terminate the policy at the request of the insured without also getting the mortgagee's consent."

| # | Guarantee |
|---|-----------|
| 1 | **Payment to mortgagee even if insured is denied** (fraud, breach, misrepresentation) |
| 2 | **No reduction/termination without notifying mortgagee** |

### Why Does the Mortgagee Have Insurable Interest?

> 💡 **From Transcript (238.88s-245.88s):** "The mortgagee of course has insurable interest in the property. The mortgagee is the lender. They provide financing for the purchase of that property."

| Mortgagee |
|-----------|
| Has insurable interest in the property |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Mortgagee Insurable Interest):**
> The bank gave you $400,000 to buy a house. If that house burns down, they want their $400,000 back. That's their "insurable interest."

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Mortgage Clause):**
> The bank loaned you $500,000 to buy a house. If the house burns down, the bank wants their money protected.
> 
> - **Guarantee 1**: If YOU commit fraud and the insurance company refuses to pay YOU, they still have to pay the BANK. The bank is innocent!
> - **Guarantee 2**: If the insurance company wants to cancel your policy, they MUST tell the bank first. The bank doesn't want to wake up one day and find out the house is uninsured.

---

## 📜 Part 8: Conditions and Warranties

> 💡 **From Transcript (250.26s-285.70s):** "Next, I want to talk about the conditions and warranties."

### Warranty:

> 💡 **From Transcript (251.91s-263.50s):** "A warranty is a promise that something is true and will remain true. When it comes to warranties, exact compliance is required. If a warranty is breached, the policy is void."

| Warranty |
|----------|
| If breached = Policy is **VOID** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Warranty = VOID if Broken):**
> A warranty is like a PINKY PROMISE. "I promise there's a fire alarm in my house." If the insurance company finds out you LIED, the entire policy is cancelled. Gone. Poof. No second chances.

---

### Conditions (2 Types):

> 💡 **From Transcript (264.94s-285.70s):** "Conditions are a requirement to do or not do something. There are two types of conditions. You have statutory conditions which are legally required by law. And because they're written in the law, they apply to everyone. Then you have policy conditions. Policy conditions are stated on the policy only and are created by the insurance companies."

| Condition Type | What It Is |
|----------------|------------|
| **Statutory Conditions** | Required by LAW, applies to everyone |
| **Policy Conditions** | Created by insurer, stated on policy only |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Warranties vs Conditions):**
> - **Warranty**: "I PROMISE this is true and will stay true." If you break it, the whole policy is CANCELLED. No wiggle room.
> - **Statutory Condition**: Written in the actual LAW BOOK. Everyone has to follow it.
> - **Policy Condition**: Written by the insurance company. Specific to YOUR policy.

---

## 🧩 Part 9: Pairs and Sets / Parts Rule

> 💡 **From Transcript (289.15s-337.86s):** "And finally, there are some claim payment rules that apply to all property insurance policies. The first rule is actually 2 rules - it's the pairs and sets and the parts rule. I've combined them here together because they essentially mean the same thing. The insurance company will only pay for the item that is lost and not the full set."

### The Rule:

| Pairs/Sets & Parts Rule |
|------------------------|
| Insurance pays for the ITEM LOST, NOT the full set |

---

### 📋 Transcript Example: Machine Part

> 💡 **From Transcript (307.87s-315.41s):** "That means if you lose one part in a machine, the insurance company will only pay for that one part, even if the machine is inoperable without that part."

| Machine is inoperable? | Too bad, still 1 part |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Machine Part):**
> Imagine your car engine has a special $500 computer chip. The chip breaks, and now your $30,000 car won't start. Insurance will give you $500 for the chip, NOT $30,000 for the car. Even though the car is now useless, they only pay for the broken PART.

---

### 📋 Transcript Example: $200 Pair of Shoes

> 💡 **From Transcript (316.30s-331.89s):** "The same goes if you lose a pair of shoes. Let's say you have a $200 pair of shoes and you lose 1 shoe. The insurance company will only pay you $100 for that missing shoe, even though nobody actually walks around with just one shoe."

| Scenario | Insurance Pays |
|----------|----------------|
| $200 pair of shoes | |
| Lose 1 shoe | $100 (half the pair) |
| Can you use 1 shoe? | No, but too bad! |

---

### 📋 Transcript Example: Dining Room Set

> 💡 **From Transcript (333.05s-337.86s):** "Same applies if you lose one part of a dining room set or any other thing of that nature."

| Lose 1 chair from 6-chair set | Only that 1 chair |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Dining Room Set):**
> Your beautiful 6-chair dining set cost $1,200. One chair gets destroyed. You might say: "But now the set doesn't match! I need a whole new set!" Insurance says: "Nope. Here's $200 for ONE chair. Good luck finding a match."

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Pairs/Parts Rule):**
> If you have a 6-chair dining set worth $1,200 and 1 chair is destroyed, you get $200 (1/6 of the set). You do NOT get $1,200 for a new set just because one chair is gone. The insurance company is very literal!

---

## 💰 Part 10: Indemnity Agreement (How Much You Get Paid)

> 💡 **From Transcript (339.27s-427.97s):** "The second rule concerns the indemnity agreement. The indemnity agreement outlines how much the insurance company will actually pay you."

### The 3 Numbers:

> 💡 **From Transcript (349.22s-363.59s):** "So the amount of settlement shall be equal to the least of these 3 numbers: Actual cash value, Interest of the insured, and Limit of insurance. They will calculate these three numbers. Whichever one is smaller is the number they will pay you."

| # | Number | Meaning |
|---|--------|---------|
| 1 | **Actual Cash Value (ACV)** | Replacement cost MINUS depreciation |
| 2 | **Interest of the Insured** | How much of the property do YOU own? |
| 3 | **Limit of Insurance** | Maximum coverage on the policy |

| You get the **SMALLEST** of the 3 numbers |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Indemnity Agreement):**
> The insurance company does NOT want to overpay you. So they calculate 3 different numbers and give you the SMALLEST one. It's like asking 3 different appraisers, and the insurance company always picks the cheapest guy's answer.

---

### 10a. Actual Cash Value (ACV)

> 💡 **From Transcript (365.55s-388.12s):** "So actual cash value means replacement cost minus depreciation. Replacement cost means whatever it costs to repair or replace your property with materials of like, kind and quality. And depreciation depends on several factors, including age, condition, value of the item, is the item going to be obsolete soon and the average lifespan of that item."

| ACV Formula |
|-------------|
| **ACV = Replacement Cost - Depreciation** |

| Depreciation Factors |
|---------------------|
| Age |
| Condition |
| Value of item |
| Obsolescence |
| Average lifespan |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (ACV):**
> You bought a TV for $1,000 five years ago. A new one costs $1,000. But YOUR old TV isn't worth $1,000 anymore—it's older and used. Maybe it's worth $400 now. That $400 is the ACV.

---

### 10b. Interest of the Insured

> 💡 **From Transcript (390.06s-411.02s):** "The second number they calculate is the interest of the insured. So they calculate your insurable interest. How much of that property do you actually own? For example, if you borrowed money from the bank to purchase a house, let's say you put 20% down, you borrowed 80% from the bank. The interest of the insured is only 20% because the bank technically owns 80% of it."

### 📋 Transcript Example: 20% Down Payment

| Scenario | Interest of Insured |
|----------|---------------------|
| House value: $500,000 | |
| Down payment: 20% ($100,000) | Your interest = 20% |
| Bank mortgage: 80% ($400,000) | Bank's interest = 80% |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Interest of Insured):**
> If you put down 20% on your house and the bank owns 80%, YOU only have 20% "Interest." If the house burns down, the bank gets paid for their 80%, and you get your 20%.

---

### 10c. Limit of Insurance

> 💡 **From Transcript (412.56s-427.97s):** "The third number they calculate then is the limit of insurance. Of course, they will only pay you up to this limit. They will not pay you more than the limit of insurance that you've purchased."

| Limit Rule |
|------------|
| Maximum = Your policy limit |
| They will NEVER pay more than the limit |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Limit of Insurance):**
> If your policy says "$200,000 Coverage" and your house is worth $500,000, you only get $200,000 max. You should have bought more coverage!

---

## 🔄 Part 11: Alternate Basis of Settlement

> 💡 **From Transcript (432.73s-566.01s):** "There are also some alternate basis of settlement. If you don't want actual cash value, you have some options."

| 3 | Valued Policy |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Alternate Settlement Options):**
> ACV (Actual Cash Value) is the DEFAULT. It's the "budget" option that pays you the depreciated value. But if you pay a little extra, you can upgrade to:
> - **Replacement Cost**: Get a brand NEW one, no depreciation deducted.
> - **Valued Policy**: An appraiser says "This painting is worth $50,000." You get $50,000 if it's destroyed. No arguments.

---

### 11a. Replacement Cost on Buildings

> 💡 **From Transcript (439.64s-489.95s):** "So you can choose replacement cost coverage for buildings. However, if you do get replacement cost on buildings, you must repair or replace your building with due diligence and dispatch meaning as quickly as you can, otherwise you won't get the full amount. When you repair, you must repair with materials of like kind and quality at the same location, or if that's not possible, at a nearby location."

| **Location** | Same location (or nearby if not possible) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Due Diligence and Dispatch):**
> "Due diligence and dispatch" is lawyer-speak for "Hurry up and fix it!" If your building burns down, don't sit on the insurance money for 5 years. Rebuild quickly, or you won't get the full replacement cost.

---

### 📋 Transcript Example: $1,000,000 Building

> 💡 **From Transcript (464.27s-489.95s):** "Typically what would happen is that the insurance company would pay you actual cash value first. Then the remainder to equal the full replacement cost coverage after the replacement has actually been made. So let's say it was replacement value was $1,000,000, actual cash value was $750,000. If your building was destroyed, the insurance company would give you $750,000 first and the rest after the replacement has actually been affected."

| Calculation | Amount |
|-------------|--------|
| Replacement cost | $1,000,000 |
| Actual Cash Value | $750,000 |
| **Step 1**: Insurance pays ACV | $750,000 |
| **Step 2**: After repair complete | +$250,000 |
| **Total** | $1,000,000 |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (RC on Buildings):**
> Insurance doesn't hand you a million dollars and say "Good luck!" They give you the depreciated value first ($750K), and AFTER you actually rebuild, they give you the rest ($250K). This prevents people from taking the money and running.

---

### 11b. Replacement Cost on Personal Property

> 💡 **From Transcript (492.10s-525.30s):** "The second alternate basis of settlement is replacement cost on personal property. However, if you do want to get replacement cost coverage on personal property, that item must have been used for its original purpose at the time of loss, and it must be replaced promptly with due diligence and dispatch, just like with the buildings."

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Original purpose** | Item must have been used for its original purpose at time of loss |
| **Replace promptly** | Due diligence and dispatch |

---

### 📋 Transcript Example: Laptop as Doorstop

> 💡 **From Transcript (513.65s-525.30s):** "So that means if you were using your laptop as a doorstop at the time of loss, you would not be able to get replacement cost coverage on that laptop because it was not being used for its original purpose at the time of loss."

| Scenario | Replacement Cost? |
|----------|-------------------|
| Laptop used as laptop | ✅ Yes |
| Laptop used as doorstop | ❌ No |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (RC on Personal Property):**
> If you were using your $2,000 laptop as a doorstop and it gets smashed, insurance will say: "That's not what a laptop is for. You get ACV, not replacement cost."

---

### 11c. Valued Policy

> 💡 **From Transcript (527.12s-544.26s):** "If you don't like actual cash value, you don't like replacement costs, your third option is to go with a valued policy. With this one, your limits are established by appraisal. They would give an appraisal of the item. And you would get coverage for whatever the appraisal amount was."

| Valued Policy |
|---------------|
| Limit established by **appraisal** |
| You get the appraised amount |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Valued Policy):**
> This is for expensive, unique items. You hire an appraiser who says "This antique is worth $50,000." If it's destroyed, you get $50,000. No depreciation arguments.

---

### Replacement Cost vs ACV Definition

> 💡 **From Transcript (545.76s-566.01s):** "So again, let's define replacement cost. Replacement cost is what it costs to repair or replace the property with materials of like kind and quality without factoring depreciation. That's the important difference between actual cash value and replacement cost. Actual cash value factors in depreciation, whereas replacement cost coverage does not."

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Replacement Cost** | Cost to repair/replace with like kind/quality, **NO depreciation** |
| **Actual Cash Value** | Replacement cost **MINUS depreciation** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (RC vs ACV):**
> - **Replacement Cost**: "How much does a NEW one cost right now?" ($1,000)
> - **ACV**: "How much is YOUR OLD one worth right now?" ($400 because it's 5 years old)

---

## 🇨🇦 2026 Canadian Context

### Property Insurance in Ontario (FSRA 2026)

| Aspect | 2026 Status |
|--------|-------------|
| **Named Perils vs Broad Form** | Both still available |
| **Deductibles** | Typically $500-$2,500 for homeowners |
| **Sewer Backup** | Often excluded, but endorsement available |
| **Earthquake** | Excluded in most policies, endorsement available |
| **Standard Mortgage Clause** | Required by all lenders |

| **Lifespan** | Short lifespan = faster depreciation |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Depreciation Factors):**
> How much is your 5-year-old laptop worth? Way less than when you bought it. That's depreciation. Insurance considers:
> - **Age**: Old stuff = less value.
> - **Condition**: Beaten up stuff = less value.
> - **Technology**: A 2020 phone is basically a brick now.
> - **Lifespan**: A laptop lasts 5 years, a fridge lasts 20 years.

### Key Points to Remember:

| Topic | Remember |
|-------|----------|
| **Personal vs Commercial** | Personal = non-business, Commercial = business |
| **Named Perils** | Only listed perils covered |
