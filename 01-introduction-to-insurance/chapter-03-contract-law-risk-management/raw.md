binding authority that you get is subject to certain limits and conditions, so you can't bind everything."]},{"start":2299.8,"end":2307.8,"text":["For example, your agency agreement might say that you can only bind dwelling in contents that are under $500,000 in limit."]},{"start":2307.8,"end":2310.8,"text":["So if it's above that, you would have to check with the underwriter first."]},{"start":2310.8,"end":2319.8,"text":["Or for example, they might force you to check with them for farm risks or certain commercial risks have to be referred to the insurance company for evaluation."]},{"start":2319.8,"end":2331.8,"text":["If you exceed your binding authority, the broker's can face an E\u0026O claim and can be liable for any losses if the insurance company had to pay for something that they didn't intend to ensure in the first place."]},{"start":2331.8,"end":2342.8,"text":["So your binding authority is defined as your ability to bind coverage as a representative

procedures."]},{"start":2497.8,"end":2502.8,"text":["So you need to remit premiums to the insurance company in several different ways."]},{"start":2502.8,"end":2509.8,"text":["The first method is the account current method where the brokerage identifies accounts that are due to the insurance company within a particular time frame."]},{"start":2509.8,"end":2516.8,"text":["Say during the previous month and then you would write a check or send a payment to the insurance company for those accounts."]},{"start":2516.8,"end":2522.8,"text":["Usually it's a one month period and most contracts will allow 30 to 60 days to pay."]},{"start":2522.8,"end":2526.8,"text":["The second method and probably the most common is the insurer statement."]},{"start":2526.8,"end":2536.8,"text":["Where the insurance company keeps track of the accounts you write with them and the insurance company sends a bill to the brokerage every month typically for the amounts that are due within that time period."]},{"start":2536.8,"end":2547.8,"text":["Agency bill is where the brokerage or the agency will bill the customer they collect the premiums and then they remit the premiums to the insurer minus the commissions that the brokerage keeps."]},{"start":2548.8,"end":2556.8,"text":["The problem with this is that clients have to pay all that up front and if they don't want to do that then they would need a lender to help set up a financing plan, especially the premiums are larger."]},{"start":2556.8,"end":2560.8,"text":["You'd have to go through a premium financing company which we'll talk about later."]},{"start":2560.8,"end":2568.8,"text":["The other issue with agency bill is that you need to keep your account receivable policies tight because you're responsible for collecting the money from the clients."]},{"start":2568.8,"end":2574.8,"text":["There's administrative work and paperwork involved in making sure that you're collecting and you're collecting on time."]},{"start":2575.8,"end":2581.8,"text":["The insurance company bills the clients directly and then they send the broker the commission every month."]},{"start":2581.8,"end":2586.8,"text":["This is less admin work, but then you get one less touch point with the client."]},{"start":2586.8,"end":2591.8,"text":["So one less opportunity to interact with them and build that relationship."]},{"start":2591.8,"end":2597.8,"text":["And if the client doesn't want to pay on a lump sum, they can do what's called a premium financing agreement."]},{"start":2597.8,"end":2606.8,"text":["That's a loan agreement entered into with a third party finance company, usually a specialized premium financing company to pay for the insurance premiums."]},{"start":2606.8,"end":2621.8,"text":["Essentially they borrow money from the premium financing company and they repay the company in loan instalment over time, often with interest and fees because of course the premium financing company needs to make money as well."]},{"start":2621.8,"end":2626.8,"text":["So the third major section of the agency agreement talks about commissions."]},{"start":2626.8,"end":2635.8,"text":["Commissions generally range from 10 to 20% of premiums and outside of commissions which is going to be your main mode of compensation."]},{"start":2635.8,"end":2645.8,"text":["You can also receive something called contingent profits or bonuses that would depend on performance or the loss ratio of the book of business you have with that insurance company."]},{"start":2645.8,"end":2654.8,"text":["So if your book of business has low losses, that means it's more profitable for the insurance company and so they will give you a bonus or they'll share some of that profit with you."]},{"start":2654.8,"end":2657.8,"text":["So let's talk about what loss ratio is."]},{"start":2657.8,"end":2665.8,"text":["A loss ratio represents the portion of money and ensure pays out in claims compared to the total amount of money they collect in premiums."]},{"start":2665.8,"end":2674.8,"text":["So the loss ratio is essentially the dollar value of their losses divided by the dollar value of their earned premiums times 100 to get the percentage."]},{"start":2674.8,"end":2687.8,"text":["So if insurance company be earns 2 million in premiums and they pay $800,000 to settle claims that year, the loss ratio would be $800,000 divided by 2 million times 100 in this case 40%."]},{"start":2687.8,"end":2691.8,"text":["There's also something called the combined ratio that they look at."]},{"start":2691.8,"end":2701.8,"text":["The formula for combined ratio is the total claims cost plus the expenses incurred divided by the earned premium and then also times 100 to get the percentage."]},{"start":2701.8,"end":2713.8,"text":["So expenses that are factored in here would include employee salaries, commissions paid to brokers, rent utilities, legal expenses and all the things that are involved with running an insurance company."]},{"start":2713.8,"end":2719.8,"text":["This combined ratio is important because it gives an accurate picture of the company's overall financial health."]},{"start":2719.8,"end":2726.8,"text":["If the ratio is over 100%, that means the insurers are incurring an underwriting loss, you know they're paying more claims and expenses than they're bringing in."]},{"start":2726.8,"end":2728.8,"text":["They're not profitable."]},{"start":2728.8,"end":2732.8,"text":["So brokers are sometimes offered incentives for maintaining a profitable book of business."]},{"start":2732.8,"end":2737.8,"text":["The incentives being getting paid to those contingent commissions."]},{"start":2737.8,"end":2752.8,"text":["So let's do another example. If company be incurred expenses of $300,000, right?

That's what the IT or management information systems department does."]},{"start":2889.8,"end":2896.8,"text":["The second major department aside from admin is going to be finance. So finance will be responsible for handling broker statements."]},{"start":2896.8,"end":2903.8,"text":["So sending statements to the broker say, hey, you wrote these accounts with us this month. You owe us this much money in net premiums."]},{"start":2903.8,"end":2915.8,"text":["The also are responsible for handling accounts payables and accounts receivables, payroll and benefits, investments because insurance companies are allowed to invest their premiums to earn a return."]},{"start":2915.8,"end":2925.8,"text":["As well as preparing any financial reports to government or management, sending commission statements to the brokers and all sorts of finance activities they would be responsible for."]},{"start":2925.8,"end":2936.8,"text":["The third and probably the most critical is the underwriting department. They're responsible for gathering statistics so they can price products profitably, meaning that you charge enough to pay for losses and expenses."]},{"start":2936.8,"end":2944.8,"text":["They're responsible for determining which risks to write. They handle the brokers finding authority or they determine that for each broker."]},{"start":2944.8,"end":2954.8,"text":["They create underwriting criteria, the issue policies and renewals, they process cancellations and all sorts of things around the specific insurance policies or products that the insurance company sells."]},{"start":2954.8,"end":2957.8,"text":["So you can think about this as the product department."]},{"start":2957.8,"end":2971.8,"text":["Also very important is claims.
