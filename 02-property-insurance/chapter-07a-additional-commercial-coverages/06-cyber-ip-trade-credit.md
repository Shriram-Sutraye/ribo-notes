## ⚠️ Three Types of Cyber Risk (17:31 - 17:46)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1044.44s-1070.04s):** "There are three types of cyber risk. The first can be a deliberate hack, meaning somebody is actually targeted to organization, perhaps with some ransomware and penetrated your systems. The second is an unintentional breach. This can be something as simple as an employee losing a laptop with sensitive information on it and the third is an operational risk. For example, if you don't install the required security software updates in time."

| 3 Types of Cyber Risk |
|----------------------|
| **1. Deliberate Hack** = Ransomware, targeted attack |
| **2. Unintentional Breach** = Lost laptop, employee mistake |
| **3. Operational Risk** = Missing software updates |

### 📋 Transcript Examples

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Deliberate | Hacker targets your company with ransomware |
| Unintentional | Employee loses laptop with customer data |
| Operational | Didn't install security patch in time |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> - **Deliberate:** Bad guys specifically attack YOU
> - **Unintentional:** Your employee makes a mistake (lost phone, clicked bad link)
> - **Operational:** You forgot to update your antivirus
> 
> All three can cause a BREACH and cost you money!

## 💸 Direct vs Indirect Cyber Losses (17:51 - 18:22)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1071.32s-1100.68s):** "Cyber risk can result in direct losses such as the actual ransom payments you have to pay, the cost of data recovery, the cost of fraudulent funds transfers, and of course privacy liability if you disclose your customer's private information. And it can also come in the form of indirect losses like extra expenses like professional fees to hire an IT person. This is a disruption loss of competitive advantage. For example, if your intellectual property has been leaked out there, reputational damage as well as loss of future opportunities."

### Direct Losses

> - Pay the ransom ($500,000)
> - Pay to recover your data ($50,000)
> - Customer sues you for leaked info
> 
> **Indirect = Long-term damage:**
> - Hire IT experts to fix the mess
> - Business can't operate for weeks
> - Customers lose trust and go elsewhere
> - Your competitors found out your secrets

## 🏢 First Party vs Third Party Cyber (18:44 - 19:30)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1118.84s-1149.56s):** "When it comes to cyber insurance, there's two types. You have first party and third party. So first party is sometimes called non-liability cyber coverage. That means it ensures cyber coverage to the organization itself, to the insured that purchased it. For example, it can offer you identity theft monitoring and restoration, remediation services, legal expenses, cyber extortion, meaning the help you deal with and pay the ransomware ransom, system failure, reputational damage, and even business interruption do to cyber."

> - System crashed? Pays for recovery
> - Lost business while down? Pays lost profits
> 
> It's about protecting YOUR company from losses.

This covers liability that you might face from third parties as a result of a cyber loss to your systems such as privacy breach, network security, remediation and defense, any regulatory defense or penalties that you might have to pay and even multimedia like."

| Third Party Coverage |
|--------------------|
| Liability to OTHERS |
| Privacy breach claims |
| Network security claims |
| Remediation and defense |

> - Government fines you for privacy violations? Covered.
> - You accidentally transmitted a virus to a client? Covered.
> 
> It's about protecting you from OTHER people's claims!

> 💡 **From Transcript (1235.88s-1274.36s):** "Another very popular and emerging type of insurance policy is called intellectual property insurance. Intellectual property is defined as things created or commissioned by a business, for example copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and even patents. IP insurance protects against IP infringement by covering your legal fees, so the legal fees involve with your defense, claims, damages, and even the settlement. Copyright insurance will cover the replication or new replication of written and creative content processes as well as software.

## 💳 Trade Credit Insurance (21:20 - 21:44)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1275.0s-1304.12s):** "Another one you might see, especially if you deal with manufacturing or import export companies, is trade credit insurance. It's similar to a surety bond in the sense that guarantees that a supplier will be paid by their customer. If the customer defaults on payment, the trade credit insurer will pay the supplier what is owed. When it comes to underwriting for trade credit insurance, credit worthiness matters, so it really depends on the financial standing and reputation of the customer. There's typically no interest charged during the payment term."

| Trade Credit Insurance |
|-----------------------|
| Guarantees supplier will be paid |
| If customer defaults → insurer pays supplier |
| Similar to surety bond |
| Used by: Manufacturers, import/export companies |

### Underwriting Factors

| Factor | Importance |
|--------|-----------|
| Customer's creditworthiness | High |
| Financial standing | High |
| Reputation | Medium |
| No interest during payment term | Benefit |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You sell $500,000 of electronics to a retailer on 90-day credit. What if the retailer goes bankrupt and never pays you? Trade credit insurance pays YOU the $500,000!
>
> It's like insurance for your invoices. If your customer can't pay, the insurer steps in.
