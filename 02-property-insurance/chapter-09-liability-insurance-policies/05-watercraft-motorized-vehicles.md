## ⛵ Watercraft: Covered But With Limits (511.33s - 555.261s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (511.33s-515.651s):** "So as you can see, watercraft is covered for liability, but with some pretty strict requirements."

> 💡 **From Transcript (515.651s-519.652s):** "So the boat cannot be over eight meters long."

> 💡 **From Transcript (519.652s-523.893s):** "It cannot be over 50 horsepower or 16 horsepower, depending on the motor."

| Watercraft Coverage Limits |
|---------------------------|
| **Length:** Cannot exceed **8 meters** |
| **Horsepower:** Max **50 HP** (or 16 HP depending on motor type) |
| **Covered?** YES—if within limits |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your home insurance DOES cover boats—but only SMALL boats!
> - **Length:** Max 8 meters (~26 feet). Think: small fishing boat, kayak, canoe, small sailboat
> - **Engine:** Max 50 horsepower (or 16 HP for certain motor types)
> 
> Bigger boat? Need separate boat insurance.

> [!NOTE]
> **Size Reference:**
> - 8 meters = about 26 feet
> - 50 HP = typical mid-size outboard motor
> - Most small recreational boats fit these limits
> - Speedboats, yachts, or large cruisers? Too big. Need specialized insurance.

### If Your Boat Exceeds Limits (523.893s - 535.896s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (523.893s-527.414s):** "There's some limitations here as far as getting it covered under your personal liability insurance."

> 💡 **From Transcript (527.414s-533.135s):** "Of course, if your watercraft exceeds those limitations, you can purchase special standalone boat insurance."

| Exceeds Limits? |
|----------------|
| Bigger boat/more HP → **NOT covered** by home insurance |
| Solution: Buy **standalone boat insurance** |
| Specialized coverage for serious boaters |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Have a 40-foot yacht? A 100 HP speedboat? Your home insurance WON'T cover it. You need to buy SEPARATE boat insurance. This specialized coverage understands the unique risks of larger boats (more expensive, more dangerous, more liability exposure).

---

### 🆕 EXCEPTION: Newly Acquired Watercraft (535.896s - 555.261s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (535.896s-540.537s):** "The exception here is for any newly acquired watercraft. If they exceed those special limits, they are still automatically covered for up to 30 days from the date of purchase."

> 💡 **From Transcript (545.058s-552.86s):** "if it's a new boat, your personal liability insurance will give you 30 days of coverage to bridge you until you can arrange standalone specialized boat insurance for that watercraft."

| Newly Acquired Boats |
|---------------------|
| **ANY size/horsepower** boat you just bought |
| **Automatically covered for 30 DAYS** |
| Time to arrange proper insurance |
| No matter how big! |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Just bought a big boat? Don't worry—you have 30 days of automatic coverage! This "bridge" period gives you time to shop for proper boat insurance without being uninsured.
> 
> Day 1-30: Home insurance covers your new boat (any size!)
> Day 31+: Better have your new boat insurance in place!

> [!WARNING]
> **Don't Wait Until Day 30!**
> The 30-day coverage is a BUFFER, not a free ride. Start shopping for boat insurance immediately. Getting quotes, comparing policies, and setting up coverage can take time.

### Buy Extra Boat Coverage (555.261s - 564.863s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (555.261s-561.982s):** "You can also buy separate coverage for the watercraft described above if more coverage is needed."

| More Coverage Needed? |
|----------------------|
| Even for small boats within limits |
| Can buy EXTRA coverage |
| Higher limits, more protection |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Even if your small boat fits under the limits, you might want MORE coverage. Maybe you take passengers out, or you boat in crowded areas. You can buy additional boat coverage as an add-on to your home policy or as separate insurance.

## 🚜 Domestic Vehicles (564.863s - 583.108s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (564.863s-569.024s):** "Domestic vehicles less than 25 horsepower are covered as well."

> 💡 **From Transcript (569.024s-573.825s):** "Examples of domestic vehicles include lawnmowers, snowblowers, and garden tractors."

| Domestic Vehicles Coverage |
|---------------------------|
| Must be **under 25 horsepower** |
| Examples: Lawnmowers, snowblowers, garden tractors |
| **COVERED** under personal liability |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> "Domestic vehicles" = motorized equipment you use around your HOME.
> - Riding lawnmowers
> - Snowblowers
> - Garden tractors
> - Small utility vehicles
> 
> If it's under 25 HP and you use it at home, your personal liability covers accidents involving it. Run over your neighbor's flower bed? Covered!

---

### Golf Carts & Wheelchairs (573.985s - 583.108s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (573.985s-578.867s):** "You also have coverage for liability arising out of motorized golf carts while on the golf course."

> 💡 **From Transcript (578.867s-583.108s):** "and motorized wheelchairs with more than two wheels designed for disabled people."

| Special Vehicles Covered |
|-------------------------|
| **Golf carts** - BUT only ON the golf course! |
| **Motorized wheelchairs** - More than 2 wheels, for disabled persons |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Two special cases:
> 
> 1. **Golf carts:** If you're playing golf and accidentally run over someone's foot with the cart—covered! But only ON the golf course. Drive it home on the street? Not covered.
> 
> 2. **Motorized wheelchairs:** If grandma's electric wheelchair accidentally bumps into someone and injures them—covered! This makes sense since wheelchairs are medical necessities, not recreational vehicles.

## 🚗 Non-Owned Vehicles (586.629s - 609.274s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (586.629s-593.991s):** "The second category is damage arising out of vehicles that are not owned by the insured."

> 💡 **From Transcript (593.991s-597.992s):** "It's important to note that damage to the craft itself is not covered."

> 💡 **From Transcript (597.992s-602.753s):** "but you will have coverage for liability arising out of any watercraft."

| Non-Owned Vehicle Coverage |
|---------------------------|
| Vehicles you **DON'T own** but use |
| Liability = COVERED ✅ |
| Damage to the vehicle itself = NOT covered ❌ |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Borrowing someone's boat or ATV? Your home insurance covers LIABILITY if you hurt someone while using it. BUT if you wreck the borrowed vehicle itself, that's NOT covered.
> 
> - You borrow friend's jet ski → crash it into a dock → hurt a swimmer = LIABILITY covered
> - You borrow friend's jet ski → crash it into a dock → wrecked jet ski = NOT covered (you owe your friend a new jet ski!)

---

### Off-Road Vehicles (600.072s - 609.274s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (600.072s-604.953s):** "as well as any self-propelled land or amphibious vehicle that's not subject to registration."

> 💡 **From Transcript (604.953s-609.274s):** "and it's mainly designed for non-public road use."

| Off-Road Vehicle Coverage |
|--------------------------|
| **Self-propelled** land vehicles |
| NOT subject to registration |
| Designed for **NON-public road** use |
| ATVs, dirt bikes, golf carts (off-course) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Vehicles that don't need license plates and aren't meant for roads—like ATVs, dirt bikes, or golf carts (off the course)—are covered for liability under your home insurance. If you're tearing around on a dirt bike and accidentally hit someone, liability is covered.

## ❌ Excluded Uses of Watercraft/Motorized Vehicles (610.875s - 636.401s)

> 💡 **From Transcript (610.875s-614.476s):** "The following uses of watercraft and motorized vehicles are not insured."

> 💡 **From Transcript (615.036s-620.237s):** "Basically, if you're using the watercraft or motorized vehicle for business purposes, you will have no coverage."

| EXCLUDED Uses |
|--------------|
| **Business purposes** = NO coverage |

---

### 📋 Transcript Examples: Business Uses That Are EXCLUDED

> 💡 **From Transcript (620.237s-625.198s):** "Examples include carrying passengers for compensation."

> 💡 **From Transcript (625.198s-629.119s):** "using it for business purposes such as as part of your landscaping business."

> 💡 **From Transcript (629.119s-633.281s):** "using it for race or speed tests if you're renting it to other people."

> 💡 **From Transcript (633.281s-636.401s):** "or if the watercraft or motorized vehicle is being used without the owner's consent."

| Specific Exclusions |
|--------------------|
| **Passenger transport for money** (ferry service, Uber on a boat) |
| **Landscaping business** (using lawnmower commercially) |
| **Racing/speed tests** |
| **Renting to others** |
| **Without owner's consent** (stolen/borrowed without permission) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your home insurance is for PERSONAL use only. The moment you use your boat or vehicle for BUSINESS, coverage disappears:
> 
> ❌ Start a fishing charter service on your boat? NOT covered
> ❌ Use your riding mower for a landscaping business? NOT covered
> ❌ Let neighbors rent your ATV? NOT covered
> ❌ Enter your boat in a racing competition? NOT covered
> ❌ Someone takes your boat without asking? NOT covered
> 
> For business use, you need commercial insurance!

> [!WARNING]
> **This Is A Common Trap:**
> People often think "I'll just use my personal boat to make some extra money during summer." WRONG! One accident while doing commercial work = massive personal liability with NO insurance coverage.
