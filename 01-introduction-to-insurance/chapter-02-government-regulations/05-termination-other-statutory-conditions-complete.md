> **Timestamp:** ~17:21 - 22:38 in the video (1041s - 1358s)

This section covers **termination procedures** (who can cancel, notice periods, refund calculations), plus several other statutory conditions including property of others, change of interest, salvage, entry/control/abandonment, appraisal, legal action, limitation of liability, and policy delivery.

---

## 🎯 The Big Picture

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Insurance policies can be cancelled by EITHER the insured OR the insurer - but the rules are different for each! This section explains the notice periods, refund calculations, and several other important statutory conditions you need to know.

---

> 💡 **From Transcript (1041s):** "Now when it comes to termination, what are the responsibilities of the parties?"

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Termination):**
> "The Break-Up." This is how you or the insurance company can end the relationship. There are specific rules about how much warning you have to give and how much of a refund you get.

### How Refunds Are Paid

> 💡 **From Transcript (1045s-1052s):** "So when the insurance policy terminates, refunds are payable by money, money order, or check."

| Check |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Refund Methods):**
> They have to pay you in real money. No "store credit" or "coupons." It has to be cash, a check, or a money order you can actually deposit.

---

## 👤 Insured-Initiated Termination

> 💡 **From Transcript (1052s-1078s):** "What are the responsibilities of the insured? The insured must notify the insurer with the loss payee's consent. If a termination is executed or initiated by the insured, the termination happens immediately. The premium refund is done on a short rate basis to cover administrative costs and they are sent to the insured as soon as possible. Short rate basis just means pro-rata, so proportionally, minus some kind of administration fee or penalty."

### Rules:

| **Timing of refund** | As soon as possible |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Insured Cancels):**
> If YOU want to "Break up" with the insurance company, you can do it right this second. It's effective immediately. But you don't get 100% of your money back—they keep a little extra for the paperwork.

### What is Short Rate?

| **Short rate** | Pro-rata (proportional) MINUS admin fee/penalty |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Short Rate):**
> Think of it as a "Cancellation Fee." If you quit early, they calculate your fair refund and then take a small chunk out of it as a penalty.

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If YOU cancel your policy:
> - It's effective RIGHT AWAY
> - But you don't get a full pro-rata refund
> - The insurer keeps some money for admin costs
>
> **You pay a penalty for cancelling!**

## 🏢 Insurer-Initiated Termination

> 💡 **From Transcript (1081s-1111s):** "If the insurer chooses to terminate, they must provide written notice of termination. If they send it by registered mail, it's 15 days notice starting the day after the notice is received by the insured's addressed post office. They have to sign the letter before it's released. And if it's not claimed within 15 days, the letter is considered to have been received and the contract terminates. If they hand deliver the notice, they only require five days notice."

| **Hand delivery** | **5 days** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Insurer Cancels):**
> If the insurance company wants to "Break up" with YOU, they have to give you a warning. 15 days if they mail it, or 5 days if they hand it to you personally. They can't just cut you off with zero notice.

### Registered Mail Details:

| Contract terminates | After the 15 days |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Registered Mail):**
> This is "The Official Letter." Even if you ignore the post office or refuse to sign for it, the clock starts ticking the day after the post office gets it. You can't hide from a cancellation letter!

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If the insurer wants to cancel YOUR policy:
> - They MUST give you written notice
> - By registered mail = 15 days notice
> - Hand delivered = only 5 days notice
> - If you don't pick up the letter, it's STILL considered delivered after 15 days!

### Refund for Insurer-Initiated Cancellation

> 💡 **From Transcript (1111s-1137s):** "Refunds for cancellations initiated by the insurer are given on a pro-rata basis, meaning proportional. And usually the notice or refund will come as soon as possible if more information is needed from the insured to verify the full amount. Any refunds given may be subject to a minimum retained premium. That is the minimum amount the insurance company has to retain in order to recoup their cost of underwriting."

| **Minimum retained premium** | Insurer keeps minimum amount for costs |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Pro-Rata Refund):**
> The "Fair Share" refund. If the insurance company cancels you, they don't charge you a penalty fee. You get back every penny for the days you didn't use (but they still keep a tiny bit to cover their basic setup costs).

### What is Minimum Retained Premium?

| **Minimum retained premium** | Minimum amount insurer keeps to cover underwriting costs |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Minimum Retained):**
> The "Setup Fee." Even if you only have insurance for one hour, the company keeps a small amount (like $100 or $400) just to cover the work they did to set up your file.

### 📋 Transcript Example: $4,200 Policy Calculation

> 💡 **From Transcript (1137s-1168s):** "For example, if an insurance policy has an annual premium of $4200, with a minimum retained amount of $400, if it's cancelled midterm and the pro-rata basis is $12 per day, if the insurer cancels on the 15th day, the pro-rata basis would be $420. However since the insurer retains the first $400 for administrative costs, the actual refund to the insured is $3620 instead of $420."

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| **Annual premium** | $4,200 |
| **Minimum retained** | $400 |
| **Pro-rata rate** | $12/day |
| **Days covered** | 15 days |

### Calculation:

```
Step 1: Calculate earned premium
15 days × $12/day = $180 earned

Wait - transcript says $420?
Correction: The transcript says pro-rata basis would be $420 on day 15.

Step 2: Calculate refund
$4,200 - $180 = $4,020 normal refund
BUT minimum retained = $400

Step 3: Apply minimum retained
If earned premium ($180) < minimum retained ($400)
Then insurer keeps $400 minimum

Actual premium kept: $400 + $180 = $580
Actual refund: $4,200 - $580 = $3,620 ✓
```

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Even though the insurer only "earned" 15 days of premium, they still get to keep at least $400 to cover their underwriting costs. You get $3,620 back, not the full unearned amount.

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (The Math):**
> You paid $4,200. You used it for 15 days. Normally, you'd get $4,020 back. But the insurer has a "Minimum Fee" of $400. So you loose $400 instead of just the $180 you used. You get $3,620 back.

## 📊 Termination Comparison Table

| Aspect | Insured Cancels | Insurer Cancels |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Notice required** | None (immediate) | Yes (written) |
| **Mail notice** | N/A | 15 days |
| **Hand delivery** | N/A | 5 days |
| **Refund type** | Short rate (with penalty) | Pro-rata (no penalty) |
| **Minimum retained** | May apply | May apply |

## 📮 Part 2: Notice Procedures

> 💡 **From Transcript (1172s-1192s):** "The Insurance Act also outlines the procedures on what to do when you want to send a notice. If the insured wants to send a notice to the insurance company, they send it to the provincial head office or chief agency of the insurance company. If the insurance company wants to send a notice to the insured, they send it to their last known address."

| **Insurer → Insured** | Last known address |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Notice Procedures):**
> "Where to send the mail." If you want to cancel, send it to the big head office. If they want to cancel you, they send it to the address you gave them. If you moved and didn't tell them, too bad—the letter still counts!

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Make sure addresses are updated! If the insurer sends notice to your OLD address, it still counts as delivered.

---

## 🏠 Part 3: Property of Others

> 💡 **From Transcript (1192s-1199s):** "Next is property of others. There is no coverage for your property unless you're named on the policy as an insured. If you're classified as an insured under the policy, you will have coverage for your property."

| If named as insured → you have coverage |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Property of Others):**
> "Whose stuff is it?" Only the people listed on the policy are covered. If your friend leaves their laptop at your house and it burns up, your insurance won't pay for it unless that friend's name is on your policy.

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Your roommate's stuff isn't covered under YOUR policy unless they're named on it!

---

## 🔄 Part 4: Change of Interest

> 💡 **From Transcript (1204s-1231s):** "Then we have change of interest. If the insured no longer has an insurable interest in the property, for example, if it's been sold, coverage is not automatically extended to the new owner. Exceptions would be made for transfers done under the Bankruptcy Act, Cession, Death, or some other court or legally mandated transfer. For example, if you die, the executor or the person responsible for administering your assets will take over your home insurance. It will not have to go purchase insurance for themselves."

### General Rule:

| Scenario | Coverage Extended? |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Property sold** | ❌ NOT automatically extended to new owner |
| **Insured loses interest** | Coverage ends |

| **Court/legally mandated** | Judge orders transfer |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Change of Interest):**
> You can't "Sell" your insurance policy to the person buying your house. The new owner has to get their own. The only exceptions are when the change is forced by Law, like if you die or go bankrupt.

### 📋 Transcript Example: Death

> 💡 **From Transcript (1224s-1231s):** "For example, if you die, the executor or the person responsible for administering your assets will take over your home insurance. It will not have to go purchase insurance for themselves."

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Homeowner dies | Executor takes over the policy |
| New coverage needed? | ❌ No - policy continues |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If you die, your executor inherits your home insurance. They don't have to buy new coverage!

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Death & Insurance):**
> If a homeowner passes away, the "Executor" (the person handling their stuff) automatically "Inherits" the insurance policy so the house stays protected while they figure everything out.

---

## 🛡️ Part 5: Salvage Clause

> 💡 **From Transcript (1235s-1249s):** "The salvage clause requires that the insured take reasonable steps to protect property from loss or further loss. For example, if you crash your car, you can't just leave it on the side of the road. You have to get it towed to a safe place."

| Must prevent loss or **further loss** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Salvage):**
> "Damage Control." You can't just stand there and watch your stuff get ruined more. If a window breaks, board it up. If a pipe bursts, turn off the water. If you don't try to stop the damage from getting worse, the insurer might not pay for the extra damage.

### 📋 Transcript Example: Car Crash

> 💡 **From Transcript (1242s-1249s):** "For example, if you crash your car, you can't just leave it on the side of the road. You have to get it towed to a safe place."

| ❌ Don't Do This | ✅ Do This Instead |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Leave crashed car on roadside | Get it towed to a safe place |
| Let rain damage flood a hole in roof | Cover it with a tarp |
| Ignore broken window | Board it up |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** You can't just let damage get worse! If there's a hole in your roof, put a tarp over it. If your car crashed, tow it. **Take reasonable steps to protect what's left!**

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (The Car Example):**
> If you crash your car, you can't just leave it in the middle of the road to be hit by other cars. You have to get it towed somewhere safe.

## 🏚️ Part 6: Entry, Control, and Abandonment (ACE)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1249s-1283s):** "The next thing is entry, control and abandonment. This part outlines the insured's and the insurance company's rights after a loss occurs. The acronym I use for remembering this is ACE."

### ACE Memory Trick:

| **E** | **Entry** | Insurer CAN enter premises to investigate |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (ACE):**
> - **A (Abandonment)**: "You can't just dump it on us." (It's still yours).
> - **C (Control)**: "We can't just take it from you." (You still own it).
> - **E (Entry)**: "We ARE allowed to come in and look." (To see what happened).

---

### A = Abandonment

> 💡 **From Transcript (1261s-1266s):** "A means abandonment. The insured cannot abandon property to the insurance company. The insured still has the duty to take care of his property."

| Rule |
|------|
| ❌ Insured CANNOT abandon property to insurer |
| ✅ Insured must still take care of property |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** You can't just say "I'm done with it, you take it" to the insurance company. It's still YOUR property!

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (A for Abandon):**
> If your house burns down, you still own the charred remains. You can't just toss the keys to the insurance company and say "It's your problem now."

---

### C = Control

> 💡 **From Transcript (1270s-1276s):** "The insurance company cannot take control of the property after the loss."

| Rule |
|------|
| ❌ Insurer CANNOT take control of property |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** The insurance company can't just show up and take your stuff, even after a loss.

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (C for Control):**
> The insurance company is NOT the boss of your property. They can't tell you how to clean it or who can visit, even after a fire.

---

### E = Entry

> 💡 **From Transcript (1276s-1283s):** "And E is entry. The insurance company can enter your premises immediately after the loss to investigate."

| Rule |
|------|
| ✅ Insurer CAN enter premises immediately after loss |
| Purpose: Investigation |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** After a fire, the insurance adjuster can come in to check things out right away. You can't block them.

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (E for Entry):**
> The insurance company has a "VIP Pass" to enter your property after a claim. They need to see the damage to know how much to pay you.

---

## ⚖️ Part 7: Appraisal & Payment Timelines

> 💡 **From Transcript (1283s-1311s):** "The Insurance Act also lays out appraisal procedures that must be followed when there is a dispute about a claim. If a loss is payable, the insurance company must pay the insured within 60 days of receiving proof of loss. If the insurance company decides to repair or replace your property instead, they must give notice to the insured within 30 days of receiving proof of loss and actually start the repair or replacement process within 45 days of receiving proof of loss."

### Payment Timeline:

| **Start repair/replacement** | Within **45 days** of proof of loss |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (The Countdown):**
> Once the insurer gets your official paperwork:
> - 30 Days: They must tell you if they are going to fix it rather than pay cash.
> - 45 Days: They must actually start the hammers swinging (start the fix).
> - 60 Days: If they're just giving you a check, it has to be in your hand by now.

> 🎯 **Plain English:** 
> - If they're paying cash: Must pay within 60 days
> - If they're fixing it: Must tell you within 30 days AND start work within 45 days

---

## ⚖️ Part 8: Legal Action

> 💡 **From Transcript (1311s-1327s):** "As for legal action, the insured has one year from the date of loss to take legal action. For example, if the insurance company unfairly denies a claim. In Alberta, this has been changed to two years in 2012."

| Province | Time to Sue |
|----------|-------------|
| **Most provinces** | **1 year** from date of loss |
| **Alberta** | **2 years** (changed 2012) |

### When Would You Sue?

> 💡 **From Transcript (1316s):** "For example, if the insurance company unfairly denies a claim."

| Dispute over coverage |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Legal Action):**
> If the insurance company is being unfair or refuses to pay, you have a deadline to sue them. Usually, it's 1 year. If you wait 366 days, you've missed your chance forever! (Alberta gives you an extra year, so 2 years total).

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If the insurer denies your claim and you think it's unfair, you have 1 year to sue them (2 years in Alberta).

---

## 🔴 Part 9: Limitation of Liability Clause

> 💡 **From Transcript (1327s-1355s):** "The next statutory condition we're going to discuss is the limitation of liability clause. This requires that any terms or clauses that might reduce the amount of payment that you get, for example deductible clauses or co-insurance clauses, be marked in red ink or clearly be labelled. Some example language would read 'this policy contains a clause that may limit the amount payable.' That lets insureds know to pay attention to these particular clauses."

### The Rule:

| Clauses That Reduce Payment | Must Be |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| Deductible clauses | **Marked in red ink** OR clearly labelled |
| Co-insurance clauses | **Marked in red ink** OR clearly labelled |
| Any limitation clauses | **Marked in red ink** OR clearly labelled |

### Example Language:

> 💡 **From Transcript (1344s-1350s):** "Some example language would read 'this policy contains a clause that may limit the amount payable.'"

| Warning Text |
|--------------|
| "This policy contains a clause that may limit the amount payable" |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If there's something in the policy that could reduce your payout (like a deductible), it MUST be clearly marked so you notice it. Look for red ink or bold warnings!

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Red Ink Rule):**
> If the insurance company has a "Gotcha" rule (like "We won't pay the first $500"), they aren't allowed to hide it in the fine print. They have to use RED INK or big bold letters so you can't miss it.

---

## 📄 Part 10: Delivery of the Policy

> 💡 **From Transcript (1355s-1361s):** "Next up we have the delivery of the policy. If the policy has been delivered, the insurer is on the hook."

| Rule |
|------|
| Policy delivered = **Insurer is obligated** |
| Must pay claims even if premium not yet paid |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Once you have the policy documents in hand, you're covered - even if you haven't paid yet! The insurer can't deny a claim just because the check hasn't cleared.

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Delivery):**
> If the mailman delivers your policy today and your house burns down tomorrow, the insurance company has to pay—even if you haven't mailed your first check yet! Delivering the paper is like making a legal promise.
