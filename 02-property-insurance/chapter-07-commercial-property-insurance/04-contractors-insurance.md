# Contractors Insurance: Builders Risk, Equipment & Installation Floaters

> **Timestamp:** 23:01 - 31:29 (1381s - 1889s)

---

## 🏗️ Contractors Insurance Overview (23:01)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1381s):** Contractors need different insurance. Premiums based on annual revenues.

| Contractors Insurance |
|----------------------|
| Premium based on annual revenues |
| Provisional premium at inception |
| Adjusted at policy expiry based on actual receipts |

---

## 🏗️ Builders Risk / Course of Construction (23:24 - 26:14)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1404s):** Bought by building owner or general contractor to ensure buildings in course of construction.

### What It Covers
| Coverage |
|----------|
| Materials owned by insured (will form part of project) |
| Landscaping & temporary buildings |
| The structure while being built |

### What It Excludes
| Excludes |
|----------|
| Tools & equipment |
| Cost of making good faulty materials/workmanship/design |
| BUT resultant damage IS covered |

### 📋 Example: Faulty Framing
> Poor workmanship causes framing to collapse. **Resultant damage = covered**, but cost to redo the framing correctly = NOT covered.

> [!TIP] **Plain Dumb Down:** Building collapses because of bad work? Insurance pays for the damage. But you pay to FIX the bad work.

### Policy Period & Limits

| Feature |
|---------|
| Limit = completed value of construction |
| Starts: when construction starts |
| Ends: when building occupied OR left unattended >30 days |

### Premium Structure
- Premium based on max value of one project (materials + labour)
- Rates LOW at inception (less to insure)
- Rates FULL at completion (more to insure)
- Must report values at stated times
- Adjusted within 30 days of completion

### Per Project vs Blanket
| Per Project | Blanket |
|-------------|---------|
| 1 project = 1 COC | Multiple projects = 1 policy |

---

## 🔧 Contractors Equipment Floater (26:14 - 27:32)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1574s):** Standard commercial property only covers equipment on premises. Floater covers movable equipment.

| Equipment Floater |
|------------------|
| Covers movable equipment (backhoes, loaders, power tools) |
| Owned, rented, or controlled by insured |
| Scheduled OR blanket basis |
| 30-day reporting requirement for new equipment |

### Coverage Includes
- Mechanical/electrical breakdown
- Temperature extremes
- Rust/corrosion
- Exceeding load limits

> [!TIP] **Plain Dumb Down:** Your tools go from job site to job site. Regular insurance doesn't cover them on the road. This floater does.

---

## 📦 Installation Floater (27:32 - 29:49)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1652s):** For specialized contractors doing installations.

### Coverage Period
| When | Coverage |
|------|----------|
| In transit to job site | ✅ |
| At job site awaiting installation | ✅ |
| During installation | ✅ |
| Until accepted OR insurable interest ceased | ✅ |

### 📋 Example: Glass Installer Story

> 💡 **From Transcript (1681s-1741s):** 

| Stage | Coverage |
|-------|----------|
| 1. Order glass, drive to job site | ✅ In transit |
| 2. Stack of glass awaiting installation | ✅ At job site |
| 3. Glass being installed | ✅ During installation |
| 4. GC signs off, pays you | ❌ Your interest ceased |
| 5. After sign-off | Covered by Builders Risk |

> [!TIP] **Plain Dumb Down:** You're a window installer. From the moment you pick up the glass until the general contractor says "looks good, here's your payment," it's YOUR insurance. After that, it's THEIR Builders Risk policy.

### Exclusions
- Tools & equipment (covered elsewhere)
- Faulty materials/workmanship/design (resultant damage covered)

---

## 🔨 Tool Floater (29:35 - 31:29)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1775s):** Covers tools used off premises on ACV basis.

| Tool Floater |
|--------------|
| Tools used off premises |
| ACV basis |
| Scheduled OR blanket |

### Optional Coverage
- Artificial electricity (power surge)
- **Mysterious disappearance**

> [!IMPORTANT] **Mysterious Disappearance:** Very common for tools to "disappear" from job sites. Push this coverage to every contractor client!

> [!TIP] **Plain Dumb Down:** Your drill "walks away" from the job site. Without mysterious disappearance coverage, you need to prove it was stolen. WITH it, you just say "it's gone" and get paid.
