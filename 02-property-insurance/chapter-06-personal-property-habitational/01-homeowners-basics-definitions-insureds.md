> **Timestamp:** 0:00 - 5:03 (0s - 303s) | **Video Duration:** ~40 minutes total

This is Part 1 of Chapter 06, covering the **foundational concepts** of personal property insurance with a focus on habitational forms.

---

## 🎯 The Big Picture

> 🎯 **Plain English:** This chapter teaches you everything about HOME insurance - who is covered, what is covered, how much you get paid, and the different types of home insurance policies (basic, broad, comprehensive).

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (The Big Picture):**
> Home insurance is like a "Protection Package" for owners, renters, and condo owners. It covers:
> - Your BUILDING (if you own it)
> - Your STUFF inside
> - Your LIABILITY (if you hurt someone or damage their stuff)
> - Your LIVING EXPENSES (if you have to move out temporarily)

## 📋 Part 1: Homeowners Forms Overview (0:00-1:03)

> 💡 **From Transcript (0.0s-24.24s):** "Now, let's do an in-depth dive into personal property insurance policies with a focus on habitational forms. The basis of all personal property insurance policies are the homeowners form. We will be discussing three of them today. The basic, the broad, and the comprehensive."

### 3 Types of Homeowners Forms:

| Form | Coverage Level |
|------|---------------|
| **Basic** | Named Perils only (13 specific perils) |
| **Broad** | Building = All Risk, Property = Named Perils |
| **Comprehensive** | All Risk for BOTH building and property |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (3 Forms):**
> - **Basic**: The "Cheap" option. Only covers 13 specific things (fire, theft, etc.). If it's not on the list, you're out of luck.
> - **Broad**: The "Middle" option. Your HOUSE gets full coverage, but your STUFF only gets the 13 perils.
> - **Comprehensive**: The "Premium" option. Everything is covered unless specifically excluded. Best protection.

### Who Can Get Homeowners Insurance?

> 💡 **From Transcript (24.24s-34.56s):** "The homeowners forms are meant to insure single-family dwellings occupied year-round by the owners or homes under construction to be occupied by the owners in the future."

| Eligible Properties |
|--------------------|
| Single-family dwellings |
| Occupied year-round by owners |
| Homes under construction (if owner will occupy) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Who Qualifies):**
> Homeowners insurance is for people who LIVE in their house (not landlords renting it out). If you're building a house and will move in when it's done, you can still get coverage.

---

### Two Common Characteristics

> 💡 **From Transcript (34.56s-50.519s):** "All homeowners forms share two common characteristics: clear language and standard format. That means all homeowners forms have two sections. Section one which talks about your property coverage and section two which talks about liability."

| Characteristic | What It Means |
|----------------|---------------|
| **Clear Language** | Easy to understand policy wording |
| **Standard Format** | Same structure across all forms |

### Two Sections:

| Section | Coverage |
|---------|----------|
| **Section 1** | Property Coverage (A, B, C, D) |
| **Section 2** | Liability Coverage (E, F, G, H) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Two Sections):**
> - **Section 1 = YOUR STUFF**: Pays to fix/replace your house and belongings.
> - **Section 2 = YOUR MISTAKES**: Pays if you accidentally hurt someone or damage their property.

---

## 👥 Part 2: Definitions - Persons Insured (0:50-1:49)

> 💡 **From Transcript (50.519s-60.599s):** "Definitions are also uniform. Persons insured means the named insured and any dependants. The named insured is any person named on the policy."

### Who is a "Person Insured"?

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Named Insured** | Person(s) named on the policy |
| **Dependants** | People living with and depending on the named insured |

---

### Who Counts as a Dependant?

> 💡 **From Transcript (60.599s-104.759s):** "Dependants are any of the following while living in the same household: A husband or wife by legal marriage or common law spouse, if you've been living together for at least three years, or only one year if you have a child together. Relatives of either that are permanently residing with the named insured will also count as dependants. As will any person under 21 years old that's in the care of the insured, meaning someone who is dependent upon the insured. But this excludes boarders and roomers because they are considered tenants and should have their own insurance. And finally, any students attending school will also count if they're being supported by the named insured or spouse while temporarily away for school."

| Dependant Type | Requirements |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Spouse (Legal)** | Married |
| **Spouse (Common Law)** | Living together 3+ years, OR 1+ year with a child |
| **Relatives** | Permanently residing with named insured |
| **Minors in Care** | Under 21, dependent on insured |
| **Students Away** | Supported by insured, temporarily away for school |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Student in Dorm

> 💡 **From Transcript (104.759s-107.359s):** "For example, while staying at a dorm room."

| Example | Covered? |
|---------|----------|
| Student living in dorm, parents pay tuition | ✅ Yes (dependant) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Dependants):**
> If someone lives with you and depends on you for money/support, they're covered too:
> - Your husband/wife
> - Your common-law partner (3 years together, or 1 year with a kid)
> - Your relatives (if they live with you permanently)
> - Kids under 21 you take care of
> - Your kid away at college
> 
> **NOT covered**: Your roommate who pays rent. They need their OWN insurance!

### ❌ Excluded: Boarders and Roomers

> 💡 **From Transcript (89.0s-95.559s):** "But this excludes boarders and roomers because they are considered tenants and should have their own insurance."

| Excluded |
|----------|
| Boarders and roomers |
| They are considered TENANTS |
| Must have their own insurance |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Roommates):**
> If your roommate pays you rent, they are NOT your dependant. They are a "tenant" and need to buy renter's insurance themselves.

## 🔑 Part 3: Named Insured vs Additional Insured vs Additional Named Insured (1:50-5:03)

> 💡 **From Transcript (107.359s-122.88s):** "So we've already learned about what the named insured is. The named insured is the primary insured on the policy. They get covered from the policy, but they're also responsible for all the things involved, like paying the premiums, getting notices, requesting policy changes, that kind of thing."

### Named Insured:

| Named Insured |
|---------------|
| Primary insured on policy |
| Gets coverage |
| Pays premiums |
| Receives notices |
| Can request policy changes |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Named Insured):**
> This is the "Main Character" on the policy. They get all the benefits, but also all the responsibilities. If the bill isn't paid, it's THEIR problem.

---

### Additional Insured

> 💡 **From Transcript (126.679s-211.12s):** "So an additional insured is an entity, meaning a person or a corporation, any kind of legal entity available in Canada. That's added to a liability policy so that they receive some protection under the policy for the named insured's acts. So they get coverage, but on a very limited basis."

| Additional Insured |
|-------------------|
| Added to LIABILITY policy |
| Gets LIMITED protection |
| Only for the named insured's acts |

---

### 📋 Transcript Example: Contractor & Homeowner

> 💡 **From Transcript (152.88s-211.12s):** "Let's say you have a house and you hire a contractor to repair your roof or to upgrade your roof. When you hire this person, you are going to request that the contractor add you as an additional insured on their policy. The reason you want to do that is because you want coverage under their policy if they mess something up or hurt somebody while they're repairing your roof. So let's say they're repairing your roof. They drop a hammer and it hits one of the pedestrians in the head that walks past your house. That pedestrian gets injured and so they're going to sue you because you're the homeowner and they're also going to sue the contractor because they were the ones that were primarily liable. So in that scenario, because you are listed as an additional insured under the contractor's policy, the contractor's policy is actually going to protect you, meaning you don't have to use your home insurance or other insurance to defend this claim."

| Scenario | What Happens |
|----------|--------------|
| Hire contractor to fix roof | |
| Contractor drops hammer on pedestrian | |
| Pedestrian sues BOTH you and contractor | |
| You are "Additional Insured" on contractor's policy | Contractor's insurance pays for YOUR defense too! |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Additional Insured):**
> You hire a roofer. The roofer drops a hammer and hurts someone. That person sues YOU and the roofer. If you're an "Additional Insured" on the roofer's policy, the roofer's insurance company pays to defend you. You don't have to use your own insurance!
> 
> **TLDR**: "Let me ride on YOUR insurance for stuff YOU do."

---

### Additional Named Insured

> 💡 **From Transcript (211.12s-274.64s):** "If you are listed as an additional named insured, you will get all the protections available under the policy just like the named insured would. That includes liability that you create yourself."

| Additional Named Insured |
|-------------------------|
| Gets FULL protection (like named insured) |
| Covers liability YOU create |
| NOT responsible for paying premiums |
| May NOT receive notices |
| Cannot cancel the policy |

---

### 📋 Transcript Example: Two Businesses Sharing Space

> 💡 **From Transcript (222.399s-250.08s):** "So let's say for example, you have two businesses and they share one office space or one retail space, doesn't matter. When they take out a liability insurance policy, one person would be the named insured, the other person might be the additional named insured. In that case, liability that either one of them creates or both of them create together would be covered under the policy. So let's say if either one forgets to put up the wet floor sign when they're mopping up and somebody slips and falls, they would both have coverage there."

| Scenario | Coverage |
|----------|----------|
| Two businesses share office | |
| Business A = Named Insured | |
| Business B = Additional Named Insured | |
| Either forgets "Wet Floor" sign | |
| Someone slips and sues | BOTH are covered! |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Additional Named Insured):**
> You and your business partner share an office. Only ONE of you is the "main name" on the policy, but BOTH of you are protected equally. If either one causes an accident, both are covered.
> 
> **TLDR**: "We're both protected the same, but only one of us pays the bill and gets the mail."

---

### Key Difference: Additional Insured vs Additional Named Insured

> 💡 **From Transcript (254.44s-274.64s):** "So you can see how that's a little bit different from how additional insured's work. So as an additional named insured, you don't have exactly the same rights and obligations as the named insured. For example, you're not responsible for paying premiums and you may not receive notices about the insurance policy or be able to cancel the insurance policy. So you're one step above additional insured, but one step below the powers of a named insured."

| Type | Protection Level | Pays Premium? | Cancel Policy? |
|------|------------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Named Insured** | Full | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Additional Named Insured** | Full | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Additional Insured** | Limited (only named insured's acts) | ❌ No | ❌ No |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Comparison):**
> Think of it like levels in a video game:
> - **Level 3 (Boss)**: Named Insured - Full power, full responsibility.
> - **Level 2 (Player)**: Additional Named Insured - Full protection, but no responsibility for bills.
> - **Level 1 (NPC)**: Additional Insured - Only protected from SOMEONE ELSE'S mistakes.

---

### Shared Limits

> 💡 **From Transcript (274.64s-303.4s):** "Where the additional piece of complexity here is that limits are shared. So if either or both of you create liability together, the limit is still the same. So if you have a million dollar limit, let's say you do something, it's still a million dollars. If somebody else does something, the other named insured does something, it's still a million dollars. If you both act together to create the liability, it's still a million dollars. So it's not a million dollars each. It's a million dollars shared between you two and either one of you can use it."

| Shared Limit Rule |
|------------------|
| Limit is NOT per person |
| Limit is SHARED between all insureds |
| $1M total, not $1M each |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Shared Limits):**
> Two people on a $1M policy does NOT mean $2M total. It means ONE bucket of $1M that you BOTH share. If you use $600K, there's only $400K left for your partner.

## 🏡 Part 4: Other Definitions (5:03-5:32)

> 💡 **From Transcript (303.4s-312.88s):** "Dwelling means a private residence and the premises is the land within the lot lines at the address noted on the policy."

### Key Terms:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Dwelling** | A private residence |
| **Premises** | The land within the lot lines at the policy address |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Dwelling & Premises):**
> - **Dwelling**: Your HOUSE (the building you live in).
> - **Premises**: Your PROPERTY (the land your house sits on, as defined by your property line).
