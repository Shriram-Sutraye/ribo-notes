# 🔄 Reinsurance - Complete Deep Dive

> **Timestamp:** ~17:04 - 22:00 in the video

This section covers **reinsurance** - how insurance companies protect THEMSELVES from too much risk. This is a critical concept for understanding how the insurance industry manages catastrophic losses.

---

## 🎯 The Big Picture

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Just like YOU buy car insurance to protect yourself from a huge accident bill, INSURANCE COMPANIES buy their own insurance to protect themselves from massive claims. This is called reinsurance.
>
> **Why does this matter?** Without reinsurance, one bad wildfire, flood, or hurricane could bankrupt an insurance company. Reinsurance spreads that risk so no single company bears it all.

---

## 📖 What Is Reinsurance?

### The Definition

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Re-insurance is when one insurer, in this case called the re-insured, cedes the risk to another insurer, the re-insurer. Basically reinsurance is when an insurance company buys insurance on an insurance policy that they wrote or a portfolio of insurance policies that they wrote."

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Reinsurance** | Insurance for insurance companies |
| **Reinsured (Cedent)** | The original insurer buying protection |
| **Reinsurer** | The company providing protection |
| **Cede** | To transfer risk to a reinsurer |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** 
> - **You** buy insurance from **Insurance Company** → They protect YOU
> - **Insurance Company** buys reinsurance from **Reinsurer** → They protect the insurance company

### Key Point: Underwriters, NOT Brokers

> 💡 **From Screenshot:** "Handled by underwriters, not brokers"

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Reinsurance is purchased and managed by the insurance company's **underwriters** (the people who assess and price risk), NOT by brokers who sell to customers. This is a behind-the-scenes operation that regular customers never see.

---

### What It Does

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "What it does is similar to what it does for a regular person - it allows the insurance company to re-insure or pass on or transfer some of the loss exposure to another party. So this allows them to stabilize the ups and the downs due to frequency or severity of losses."

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Insurance companies face the same problem you do - big unexpected bills can be devastating. Reinsurance helps them:
> - **Stabilize** the financial ups and downs
> - **Survive** catastrophic events
> - **Keep operating** even after massive claims

---

### Real-World Example: Small-Town Insurer

> 💡 **From Screenshot:** "Example: Small-town insurer reinsures flood risk to avoid claim overload"

> 🎯 **Plain English - Let's Walk Through It:**
>
> **Scenario:** You run a small insurance company in a town near a river. You insure 500 homes.
>
> **The Problem:** If the river floods, you might get 200 claims at once. That's millions of dollars - way more than your small company can afford.
>
> **The Solution:** You buy reinsurance for flood risk. Now if the big flood happens:
> - You pay some claims (your "retention")
> - The reinsurer pays the rest
> - Your company survives!
>
> **Without reinsurance:** One flood = bankruptcy
> **With reinsurance:** One flood = manageable

**2026 Canada Context:**
- 2024 saw $8.5 billion in severe weather property losses (nearly 3x 2023)
- 1.5 million Canadian households in high-risk flood areas
- Proposed National Flood Insurance Program could help smaller insurers manage flood risk

## 🔄 Retrocession (Reinsurance for Reinsurers!)

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "There's a key term you need to know here called Retrocession, which is when a reinsurer cedes the risk again to another person, the Retrocessionnaire. So that means the reinsurance company buys reinsurance on the reinsurance policy they just wrote."

> 💡 **From Screenshot:** "Retrocession = reinsurer passes risk again"

| Term | What It Means |
|------|---------------|
| **Retrocession** | When a reinsurer buys reinsurance for themselves |
| **Retrocessionnaire** | The company that takes on the reinsurer's risk |

> 🎯 **Plain English - The Chain of Protection:**
>
> ```
> 🏠 YOU (Homeowner)
>     └─ buys insurance from → 🏢 INSURANCE COMPANY (e.g., Intact)
>                                  └─ buys reinsurance from → 🌍 REINSURER (e.g., Munich Re)
>                                                                 └─ buys retrocession from → 🌐 RETROCESSIONNAIRE
> 
> It's insurance ALL the way down! 🐢
> ```
>
> **Why does this exist?** Because even GIANT reinsurers like Munich Re or Swiss Re face risks that are too big. A massive earthquake could hit them with $50 billion in claims. So they ALSO spread their risk.

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "So acquiring reinsurance is usually done by the insurance companies and the underwriters, so it's not typically something that brokers or agents even know about."

> 🎯 **Plain English:** As a broker or customer, you'll never see this. It happens in the background. But it's why insurance companies can survive disasters - there's a whole chain of protection behind them.

## 🤔 Why Do Insurance Companies Use Reinsurance?

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Why is reinsurance used? What are the benefits of reinsurance?"

There are **4 main reasons:**

---

### Reason 1️⃣: Increase Capacity

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "It increases capacity, meaning it increases the amount of coverage that the insurance company can take on. Maybe they don't want to have $5 million tied up in one risk. So what they might do is reinsure $4 million of it so it frees up that capacity so they can write other business. Essentially it takes some risk off their books so then they can write more business."

> 💡 **From Screenshot:** "Frees capital to write more business. Ex: Reinsure $4M of a $5M risk"

**The $5M Risk Example (KEY!):**

| Scenario | Without Reinsurance | With Reinsurance |
|----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Big risk comes in | $5M tied up in one policy | Reinsure $4M, keep $1M |
| Your capacity | $5M locked | Only $1M locked |
| Free capacity | $0 for other business | $4M freed up! |
| Can you write more policies? | ❌ No room | ✅ Yes! |

> 🎯 **Plain English - Think of it like a credit card:**
>
> You have a $10,000 credit limit. You charge $5,000 on one purchase. Now you only have $5,000 left for everything else.
>
> **With reinsurance:** It's like transferring $4,000 of that charge to someone else. Now you have $9,000 available again!
>
> **The result:** Insurance companies can write MORE policies and serve MORE customers because they're not locked into single big risks.

---

### Reason 2️⃣: Manage Reserve Ratios (Meet Insurance Act / GAAP Rules)

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "There are rules that say that they can't write more business than a certain multiple of the cash or liquid assets that they hold. So again they use reinsurance to get some of the money off their books so they can write more business and write more policies. Premium capacity is defined as the amount an insurance company can safely write based on some general accounting principles and also the Insurance Act."

> 💡 **From Screenshot:** "Meet Insurance Act / GAAP rules. Shifts obligations off the books"

> 🎯 **Plain English - The Regulatory Rules:**
>
> The government says: "You can only write X amount of insurance based on how much cash you have."
>
> **Why?** To make sure insurance companies can actually PAY claims.
>
> | Metric | Rule |
> |--------|------|
> | Minimum Capital Test (MCT) | Must be at least 100% |
> | Supervisory Target | 150% |
> | What this means | Cash reserves must cover potential claims |
>
> **The problem:** If you write too much business, your ratio gets too low and regulators get upset.
>
> **The solution:** Reinsurance shifts obligations OFF your books, improving your ratio so you can write more business while staying compliant.

**2026 Canada Update:**
- OSFI Minimum Capital Test (MCT) Guideline effective January 1, 2026
- Minimum ratio: 100%
- Supervisory target: 150%
- Insurers must maintain internal target ABOVE 150%

---

### Reason 3️⃣: Catastrophe Protection

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "It also offers catastrophe protection from things like natural disasters. Certain catastrophic events can cause insurance companies to pay huge sums of money and potentially go bankrupt. So they use reinsurance or retrocession to spread that risk to prevent a big catastrophic event from taking them out. Similar to how a regular person might use insurance."

> 💡 **From Screenshot:** "Spreads risk of major disasters (e.g. wildfire, flood). Retrocession adds extra protection"

| Catastrophe Type | 2024 Canada Impact |
|------------------|-------------------|
| 🔥 Wildfires | Record losses |
| 🌊 Floods | $8.5 billion total severe weather losses |
| ⛈️ Storms | Nearly 3x increase from 2023 |

> 🎯 **Plain English - The Survival Insurance:**
>
> Imagine you insure 10,000 homes in Fort McMurray. A massive wildfire hits - 5,000 homes destroyed.
>
> | Scenario | Without Reinsurance | With Reinsurance |
> |----------|--------------------|--------------------|
> | Claims | $1 billion | $1 billion |
> | You pay | $1 billion 😰 | $100 million (retention) |
> | Reinsurer pays | $0 | $900 million |
> | Outcome | Possible bankruptcy | You survive! |
>
> **The key insight:** Catastrophes don't happen every year, but when they do, they're MASSIVE. Reinsurance is specifically designed for these rare-but-devastating events.

---

### Reason 4️⃣: Exit a Business Line

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "They might also use reinsurance when they're leaving a class of business. If you don't want to write a particular class of business anymore, say restaurants for example, and you want to get those liabilities off your books, you can just reinsure your entire portfolio of restaurant insurance policies instead of canceling those customers. So you just reinsure all of their, that frees up your capacity, you're no longer exposed to the risk of restaurants and you can write other business."

> 💡 **From Screenshot:** "Reinsure liabilities instead of cancelling policies risk to avoid claim overload"

> 🎯 **Plain English - The Graceful Exit:**
>
> **Scenario:** Intact Insurance decides they don't want to insure restaurants anymore (too risky, not profitable, whatever reason).
>
> **Option A (Bad):** Cancel 5,000 restaurant policies
> - ❌ Customers are angry
> - ❌ Brokers are angry
> - ❌ Bad reputation
> - ❌ Regulatory issues
>
> **Option B (Good):** Reinsure the entire restaurant portfolio
> - ✅ Customers keep their coverage
> - ✅ Brokers keep their commissions
> - ✅ Intact is no longer exposed to restaurant risk
> - ✅ Intact can focus on other business
>
> **The result:** Everybody wins. Customers are protected, Intact is out of the restaurant business, and a reinsurer now holds that risk.

## 📋 4 Types of Reinsurance Contracts

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "There are four different types of reinsurance contracts and they vary based on the way they're placed and the way premiums and losses are shared."

---

### Type 1: Treaty Reinsurance

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Treaty reinsurance covers all policies within a particular class. So let's say restaurants - you can arrange a treaty reinsurance policy for restaurants and all restaurants that you write are covered by this treaty reinsurance policy."

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Coverage** | ALL policies within a class/category |
| **Arrangement** | Pre-negotiated, automatic |
| **Example** | "Reinsure ALL our restaurant policies" |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** It's a blanket agreement. Once you set it up, every new policy in that category is automatically covered. No negotiation needed for each individual policy.
>
> **Like:** A bulk discount agreement. "Everything in this category is covered."

---

### Type 2: Facultative Reinsurance

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "This is arranged separately for each policy. So let's say you write a particularly large policy to ensure a skyscraper. You might want to arrange special reinsurance just for that one policy."

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Coverage** | ONE specific policy |
| **Arrangement** | Negotiated individually |
| **Example** | "Reinsure this ONE $100M skyscraper" |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** It's a custom, one-off deal. You negotiate terms specifically for this one big/unusual risk.
>
> **Like:** Ordering a custom suit vs. buying off the rack.

**Quick Comparison:**

| Feature | Treaty | Facultative |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Covers | Whole class | Single policy |
| Automatic? | Yes | No - negotiate each one |
| Best for | Routine business | Large/unusual risks |

---

### Type 3: Proportional Reinsurance

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "All of the business is reinsured and you share all losses and premiums based on a percentage split. So this helps you balance the frequency and severity of losses. So let's say I have a $100 million insurance portfolio. I can arrange a proportional reinsurance policy on a 50-50 split. So when I receive premiums, half of that goes to the reinsurance company and when I pay losses, half of that is paid by the reinsurance company."

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **How It Works** | Share BOTH premiums AND losses by percentage |
| **Split** | e.g., 50/50, 70/30, 60/40 |
| **Purpose** | Balance overall book performance |

**The 50/50 Split Example:**

| Event | Your Share (50%) | Reinsurer Share (50%) |
|-------|------------------|----------------------|
| Premium collected: $1,000 | $500 → You | $500 → Reinsurer |
| Claim paid: $800 | $400 → You pay | $400 → Reinsurer pays |
| Net result | $100 profit | $100 profit |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** You share EVERYTHING proportionally. The good (premiums) and the bad (claims). It's like having a business partner who shares both the income and the expenses.

---

### Type 4: Non-Proportional Reinsurance (MOST COMMON!)

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "This is the most common - basically the reinsurance company would pay losses above a certain dollar value. The retention limit is how much the insurance company is responsible for - it's almost like a deductible for a reinsurance policy. The benefit is it helps limit the severity of loss."

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **How It Works** | Reinsurer pays losses ABOVE a threshold |
| **Retention Limit** | Your "deductible" - what you pay before reinsurance kicks in |
| **Purpose** | CAP your maximum possible loss |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** It's exactly like having a deductible on your car insurance. You pay the first $X, then insurance kicks in for everything else.

**The $3M Wildfire Example (KEY!):**

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Let's say I'm an insurance company and I enter into a non-proportional reinsurance agreement. I agree to retain up to $3 million for wildfire claims in Ontario. I would pay a fee to the reinsurance company for this coverage over a set period of time, say annually. So that summer if wildfires cost $10 million in losses and my retention limit is $3 million - I'm only required to pay the first $3 million in claims and the reinsurance company would cover the remaining $7 million. So it helps me cap my exposure or cap and limit my risk at $3 million."

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Wildfire claims total | $10 million |
| Your retention limit | $3 million |
| **You pay** | $3 million |
| **Reinsurer pays** | $7 million |

> 🎯 **Plain English - Step by Step:**
>
> 1. You agree: "I'll keep the first $3M of wildfire losses" (retention)
> 2. You pay a PREMIUM to the reinsurer for this protection
> 3. Wildfire season hits - $10M in claims
> 4. You pay $3M (your retention)
> 5. Reinsurer pays $7M (everything above your retention)
> 6. Your maximum loss is CAPPED at $3M - no matter how bad it gets!
>
> **Why is this the most common?** Because it specifically protects against CATASTROPHIC losses while letting you keep the routine claims.

## 🧠 Exam Tips

> [!TIP]
> **Memory Hooks:**
> - **Reinsurance** = "Insurance for insurers"
> - **Retrocession** = "Reinsurance for reinsurers" (it's turtles all the way down!)
> - **Retention** = "Your deductible as an insurance company"

### Key Distinctions to Memorize:

| Type | Remember As |
|------|-------------|
| **Treaty** | "Blanket" - covers whole class automatically |
| **Facultative** | "One-off" - custom for one big risk |
| **Proportional** | "Share everything" - premiums AND losses |
| **Non-Proportional** | "Your deductible" - you pay first $X, they pay rest |

### The 4 Reasons for Reinsurance (Memory Hook: "CERM"):

1. **C**apacity - Free up capital to write more business
2. **E**xit - Leave a business line without canceling customers
3. **R**eserves - Meet Insurance Act / GAAP ratio requirements
4. **M**ajor catastrophe protection - Survive disasters

### Examples You MUST Remember:

| Example | Concept |
|---------|---------|
| $4M of $5M risk | Capacity - frees up capital |
| $3M wildfire retention | Non-proportional - caps your loss |
| 50/50 split | Proportional - share everything |
| Restaurant portfolio exit | Treaty - reinsure whole class |
| $100M skyscraper | Facultative - one-off custom |
| Small-town flood | Why reinsurance exists - survival |
