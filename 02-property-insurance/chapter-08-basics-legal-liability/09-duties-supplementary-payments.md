---

## 📋 Duties of the Insured (24:00 - 25:00)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1426.96s-1433.28s):** "Now let's talk about the duties of the insured in the event of an occurrence or claim."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1433.28s-1439.44s):** "So when there is an occurrence or claim, the insured generally must cooperate."

| Duties in an Occurrence/Claim |
|------------------------------|
| Insured must **COOPERATE** |
| Several specific duties |

---

## 🔤 P-A-L-A-C Acronym (24:10 - 25:00)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1439.44s-1444.56s):** "A handy acronym I use for remembering these duties is PALAC, but feel free to come up with your own."

| P-A-L-A-C |
|-----------|
| **P** = Prompt Notice |
| **A** = Assist |
| **L** = Legal Papers |
| **A** = Authorize |
| **C** = Cannot Make Voluntary Payments |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> **PALAC** = The 5 things you MUST do when something happens:
> - **P**romptly notify insurer
> - **A**ssist with investigation
> - Send **L**egal papers immediately
> - **A**uthorize them to get info
> - **C**an't pay the victim yourself

---

### P = Prompt Notice

> 💡 **From Transcript (1444.56s-1450.72s):** "So P stands for prompt notice. You have to provide problem notice to the insurance company of any occurrence that might lead to a claim."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1450.72s-1456.48s):** "Even if the claim hasn't actually been filed yet."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1456.48s-1461.28s):** "So you have to tell them the time, place, circumstance, and contact information for any witnesses."

| P = Prompt Notice |
|------------------|
| Notify insurer of ANY occurrence |
| Even if claim not filed yet |
| Include: Time, place, circumstances |
| Contact info for witnesses |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> See something bad happen? CALL YOUR INSURER IMMEDIATELY—don't wait for a lawsuit. Tell them:
> - When it happened
> - Where it happened
> - What happened
> - Who saw it (witness info)

---

### A = Assist

> 💡 **From Transcript (1461.28s-1466.96s):** "You also have to assist in any investigation, settlement or defense."

| A = Assist |
|-----------|
| Help with investigation |
| Help with settlement |
| Help with defense |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> When your insurance company investigates, you CAN'T just disappear. You have to:
> - Answer their questions
> - Show up when needed
> - Help them build the case

---

### L = Legal Papers

> 💡 **From Transcript (1466.96s-1472.56s):** "Any legal papers you receive must be immediately forwarded to the insurance company."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1472.56s-1478.88s):** "A lot of these legal papers have a time limit on when you have to respond."

| L = Legal Papers |
|-----------------|
| Forward ALL legal papers to insurer |
| **IMMEDIATELY!** |
| Many have response deadlines |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Got served with a lawsuit? DON'T SIT ON IT! Send it to your insurance company RIGHT AWAY. Legal papers have DEADLINES—if you miss them because you waited, you could lose by default!

---

### A = Authorize

> 💡 **From Transcript (1478.88s-1488.64s):** "You must also authorize the insurance company to obtain any information they need, whether that be police reports or medical records."

| A = Authorize |
|--------------|
| Authorize insurer to get info |
| Police reports |
| Medical records |
| Any other needed information |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> The insurance company needs information to defend you. You have to sign off and let them access:
> - Police reports
> - Medical files
> - Any other records they need
> 
> Don't block them—they're on YOUR side!

---

### C = Cannot Make Voluntary Payments

> 💡 **From Transcript (1488.64s-1494.48s):** "You also cannot make any voluntary payments to the victims other than providing them first aid."

| C = Cannot Make Voluntary Payments |
|-----------------------------------|
| NO voluntary payments to victim |
| **Exception:** First aid is OK |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> DO NOT pay the victim anything! If you hand them $5,000 saying "sorry," you just admitted guilt AND you can't get that money back from insurance.
> 
> **Only exception:** You CAN pay for bandages and first aid.

---

## 💰 Supplementary Payments (25:07 - 26:20)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1494.48s-1504.08s):** "Now on top of the damages that are paid by the liability policy, the insurance company will also cover you for supplementary payments."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1504.08s-1509.52s):** "Supplementary payments include the cost of defense, the expenses incurred by the insured in order to assist and he court costs assessed against the insured or any interest payable."

| Supplementary Payments |
|-----------------------|
| **ON TOP of** damages limit |
| Include: |
| - Cost of defense |
| - Expenses of the insured |
| - Court costs |
| - Interest payable |

> 💡 **From Transcript (1509.52s-1521.04s):** "This supplementary payments are made on top of your limit of insurance. Your limit of insurance only exists to pay damages. The supplementary payments are paid in access of that."

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **KEY POINT:** Supplementary payments are EXTRA—they don't eat into your damage limit! If you have $1M coverage, you get $1M for damages PLUS supplementary payments on top!

---

### Cost of Defense

> 💡 **From Transcript (1521.04s-1525.76s):** "So cost of defense is very straightforward. Legal fees, the cost of hiring expert witnesses, and other expenses of that nature."

| Cost of Defense |
|----------------|
| Legal fees |
| Expert witnesses |
| Other litigation expenses |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your insurance pays for:
> - The lawyer who defends you
> - Expert witnesses (doctors, engineers, etc.)
> - Court reporter fees, filing fees, etc.
> 
> You don't pay for your own defense—insurance does!

---

### Expenses of the Insured

> 💡 **From Transcript (1531.84s-1538.159s):** "What about expenses of the insured? So expenses of the insured are basically expenses that the insured has paid for out of pocket in order to assist the insurance company with the defense, investigation or settlement."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1538.879s-1543.6s):** "This includes loss wages for having to show up in court, transportation fees to and from court, and other reasonable expenses."

| Expenses of the Insured |
|------------------------|
| Out-of-pocket costs to assist |
| Lost wages (court appearances) |
| Transportation to/from court |
| Other reasonable expenses |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> If you miss work to go to court, insurance reimburses your lost wages. If you drive downtown for depositions, they pay for parking and gas. Any reasonable expense you incur helping your own defense gets reimbursed.

---

### Court Costs Assessed

> 💡 **From Transcript (1553.6s-1559.04s):** "Court costs assessed against the insured, meaning that sometimes courts will require the insured to pay court costs if you lose. The insured's company will pay for those."

| Court Costs |
|------------|
| Courts sometimes require loser to pay costs |
| Insurance covers these too! |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> If you lose the case, the court might say "pay the court costs." Your insurance covers that too. You won't be out-of-pocket for court filing fees and administrative costs.

---

### Bond Premiums

> 💡 **From Transcript (1559.04s-1568.72s):** "Also, bond premiums. If you want to file an appeal or do other legal manoeuvres, the court might require you to post a bond. The insured's company will pay the premiums on those bonds."

| Bond Premiums |
|--------------|
| Appeals require posting bonds |
| Insurance pays bond premiums |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Want to appeal a verdict? Courts might say "post a $50,000 bond first." That bond has a premium (like insurance for the appeal). Your insurance pays that premium.

---

### Interest Payable

> 💡 **From Transcript (1574.639s-1586.08s):** "Also, an interest payable on amounts up to or less than your limited insurance will be covered."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1586.08s-1591.52s):** "Usually what happens is the plaintiff doesn't get paid for their damages until the right of appeal has passed."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1591.52s-1597.199s):** "In the meantime, interest will accrue on that amount."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1597.199s-1602.8s):** "The insurance company will pay for that."

| Interest Payable |
|-----------------|
| Plaintiff waits for money (appeal period) |
| Interest accrues during wait |
| Insurance pays that interest |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> After you lose, you might appeal. While waiting, the money you owe earns INTEREST. When you finally pay, insurance covers that interest too—so the victim gets the full amount including interest without taking away from your limit.

---

## 🎯 Different Policies for Different Activities (26:20 - 26:47)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1602.8s-1607.84s):** "It's important to know that different liability policies exist for different activities."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1607.84s-1613.439s):** "If you run a business, fly an aircraft, or have professional liability, you will need to purchase different insurance policies."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1613.44s-1616.16s):** "We'll talk more about those in detail later on."

| Different Liability Policies |
|-----------------------------|
| Business liability |
| Aircraft liability |
| Professional liability |
| Each activity needs specific coverage |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> One size does NOT fit all! Different activities need different insurance:
> - Running a store? Commercial General Liability
> - Flying planes? Aviation liability
> - Doctor/lawyer? Professional liability (E&O)
> 
> Make sure you have the RIGHT coverage for what you do!
