# 📖 Definition of Insurance

> **Timestamp:** ~3:02 in the video

Insurance is defined through **5 key components** that work together to form the complete definition:

---

## 1️⃣ Transfer Risk

**The agreement between the insurance company and the insured to transfer risk.**

- Insurance is a **contract** that allows the insured to transfer risk to the insurance company
- If anything happens, it's the **insurance company that has to pay**, not you
- You're essentially shifting your financial exposure to the insurer

> 💡 **Example:** If your house burns down, the insurance company bears the financial burden, not you.

---

## 2️⃣ Promise to Pay

**The insurance company promises to pay when:**

1. A **specific peril** damages an **object of insurance**
   - Example: Fire damages your house
2. When the insured **causes loss to other people** 
   - This is called **liability insurance** (covered later)

---

## 3️⃣ Accidental Losses Only

**Insurance will ONLY pay for accidental losses that happen AFTER the agreement starts.**

### ❌ What's NOT Covered:
- Things that happened **before** you bought insurance
- Things you do **on purpose** (intentional acts)

> ⚠️ **Key Point:** You cannot buy fire insurance while your house is already on fire and expect coverage!

---

## 4️⃣ Principle of Indemnity

**The amount of payment you get for a claim equals the amount of loss based on the value of the object immediately prior to the loss.**

### What This Means:
- You get paid based on the **actual value** at the time of loss
- Factors like **depreciation** are considered
- You're made "whole" again, not given extra money to profit

> 🔑 **Purpose:** Prevents people from profiting from insurance claims - you're restored to your pre-loss financial position, nothing more.

---

## 5️⃣ Money or Repair/Replace

**Payment can be in the form of:**

1. **💵 Cash payment** - Direct money to you
2. **🔧 Repair** - Pay to fix your property
3. **🔄 Replace** - Pay to replace your property with a similar one

> ⚡ **Important:** The **insurance company chooses** whether to pay cash or repair/replace your property - not you!

## 🇨🇦 2026 Canadian Context

> [!NOTE]
> These are current industry updates relevant to understanding insurance in Canada for 2026.

### Principle of Indemnity - Real-World Application

The principle of indemnity is a **cornerstone of P&C (Property & Casualty) insurance** in Canada:

- Aims to restore the insured to the **exact financial position before the loss** - no more, no less
- Helps **prevent insurance fraud** by ensuring no one profits from a claim
- **Exception:** "Rebuilding Cost Guarantee" coverage can extend beyond strict indemnification when actual rebuilding costs exceed property value

### Transfer of Risk in 2026

The Canadian insurance industry continues to face **challenges with accidental losses**, particularly from:

| Natural Catastrophe | Impact in 2026 |
|---------------------|----------------|
| 🔥 Wildfires | Increased frequency and severity |
| 🌊 Floods | New national flood insurance program being developed |
| ⛈️ Hailstorms | Major claims driver in prairies |
| 🌪️ Severe storms | Growing impact on personal lines |

> [!WARNING]
> Insurers are **revising risk models**, adjusting premiums, and tightening coverage in high-risk areas due to climate change impacts.

### Ontario Auto Insurance Reforms (July 1, 2026)

A major change affecting the "Promise to Pay" component:

- **Before:** Bundled system with mandatory accident benefits
- **After:** **Modular system** - consumers can choose which benefits to include
- Previously mandatory benefits (income replacement, caregiver support) become **optional**

> [!CAUTION]
> Risk of **underinsurance** if consumers opt out of essential coverage without understanding implications.

### P&C Market Conditions

| Factor | 2026 Status |
|--------|-------------|
| Commercial rates | Stabilizing/declining after years of increases |
| Competition | Increased, including from international insurers |
| Personal lines | Volatile due to natural catastrophe losses |
| Investment income | Higher, contributing to rate stability |
