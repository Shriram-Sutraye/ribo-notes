# 🏢 Insurance Categories & Insurers

> **Timestamp:** ~4:24 - 10:55 in the video

This section covers the **types of general insurance** (P&C) and the **different types of insurance companies** that operate in Canada.

---

## 📦 General (P&C) Insurance Categories

**General Insurance** = Property & Casualty Insurance

> 🎯 **Plain English:** "General insurance" is just a fancy name for insurance that covers your STUFF (property) and protects you if you accidentally HURT someone or damage their stuff (casualty/liability). It does NOT include life insurance or health insurance.

There are **3 main categories** of general insurance:

### 1️⃣ Automobile Insurance 🚗

- **Largest by volume** - Required by law in Canada
- If you own/drive a car, you **must** have auto insurance

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "If you want to drive a car, you owe the car, you need to buy auto insurance."

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Car insurance. You literally cannot legally drive without it in Canada. That's why it's the biggest category - everyone who drives has to buy it.

### 2️⃣ Property Insurance 🏠

Covers physical property against damage or loss.

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Personal Property** | Your home, condo |
| **Commercial Property** | Commercial buildings, manufacturing facilities, equipment |

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "That encompasses both personal property - so like your personal home, your condo - as well as business property like commercial buildings, manufacturing facilities, equipment."

> 🎯 **Plain English:** This covers your physical STUFF - your house, your condo, or if you're a business, your building and equipment. If a fire burns it down or someone steals it, this pays to fix/replace it.

### 3️⃣ Liability Insurance ⚖️

Protects you if you're **legally responsible** for causing injury or damage to someone else.

- This is the **"casualty"** part of Property & Casualty

> 💡 **Real Example from Transcript:** 
> *"If you operated a store, someone slipped on the wet floor, hit their head - you might have liability for that. Liability insurance would protect you from that if you get sued."*

> 🎯 **Plain English:** This is your "oops I hurt someone" insurance. If someone slips in your store, crashes because of you, or you accidentally damage their property - and they SUE you - this insurance pays for your legal defense and any money you owe them. Without it, you'd pay out of pocket, which could bankrupt you.

## 🏛️ Types of Insurers

In Canada, there are **two main types**: Government and Private

---

### 1️⃣ Government Insurance 🏛️

**Compulsory insurance offered by government bodies - you HAVE to buy it (mandatory).**

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| 🏥 Provincial Health Plan | OHIP, MSP |
| 💼 Employment Insurance (EI) | Federal program |
| 🔧 Workers Compensation | WSIB, WorkSafeBC |

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Government insurance is typically compulsory... things like employment insurance (EI), your provincial health plan, workers compensation. All that type of stuff is purchased through a government body and it's typically compulsory - meaning you have to buy it, it's mandatory."

> 🎯 **Plain English:** This is insurance the GOVERNMENT forces you to have. You don't choose - it's automatically deducted from your paycheck (like EI) or provided to all residents (like OHIP healthcare). No shopping around, no options - the government runs it.

---

### 2️⃣ Private Companies 🏢

### A) Stock Companies 📈

**Owned by shareholders, profit-oriented, for-profit business**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Ownership** | Shareholders |
| **Objective** | Generate profits for shareholders |
| **Capital Source** | Private funds OR public issuance of stock (list on exchange, get investors) |
| **Profits** | Reinvested to grow business OR paid as dividends to shareholders |

> ✅ **Key Point:** "Private stock companies in Canada write MOST of the insurance policies we have here."

> 🇨🇦 **Canadian Example from Transcript:**
> *"A common example of a stock company is Intact Insurance. You can buy their stock on the TSX and they are owned by shareholders and they are a for-profit business."*

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Think of these like any regular company you can invest in (like Apple or Google). They have shareholders who own pieces of the company. Their #1 goal is to MAKE MONEY for those shareholders. Intact is a perfect example - you can literally buy their stock on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Most insurance in Canada comes from these types of companies.

---

### B) Mutual Companies 🤝

**Owned by policyholders (called "members"), NOT profit-oriented**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Ownership** | Policyholders = **Members** |
| **Objective** | Collect just enough premiums to cover losses and operations (just cover costs) |
| **Result** | Typically the **cheapest insurance** |
| **Claims** | Usually most **friendly and lax** when adjusting claims |

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "They're usually the most friendly and lax when it comes to adjusting claims. Oftentimes they'll pay claims that they don't really have to."

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Imagine you and your neighbors all pitch in money to cover each other's losses - that's basically a mutual. There are no outside investors trying to make profit off you. YOU (the customers) actually OWN the company. Since they're not trying to make shareholders rich, they charge less AND are nicer when you file a claim. The downside? If the company loses money, YOU (the members) might have to pay extra.

#### What Happens with Surplus/Shortfall?

| Situation | What Happens |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Company loses money** | Members **pay extra** to make up the shortfall |
| **Surplus of money** | Paid out to members as dividend, reinvested, OR kept in reserve for a rainy day |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** 
> - **Bad year (lots of claims)?** → They might ask members to chip in more money
> - **Good year (few claims)?** → Members might get money back, or the company saves it for later

## 📋 4 Types of Mutual Companies (DETAILED)

### 1️⃣ Assessment Mutual

**Every policyholder is a member, together they elect a board of directors.**

#### How It Works:

```
Step 1: Insured signs a PREMIUM NOTE
        └─ Face value = Maximum premium payable

Step 2: Insured pays an INITIAL PREMIUM 
        └─ Just a portion of the premium note

Step 3: IF the mutual doesn't collect enough premiums from other members...
        └─ They ASSESS the insured for the rest of the money
        └─ This remaining amount = "UNCALLED PORTION"
```

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "The insured signs a premium note with a face value that would be equal to the maximum premium payable. The insured pays a portion of that in what they call an initial premium. If the mutual doesn't end up collecting enough premiums from the other members in order to cover all the losses, they might require the insured to pay the rest. So they would assess them for the rest of the money, which is known as the uncalled portion."

> 🎯 **Plain English - Let me break this down like you're 5:**
> 
> Imagine joining a club where everyone shares costs for emergencies:
> 
> 1. **Premium Note** = You sign a paper saying "I COULD owe up to $1,000 this year" (that's the maximum)
> 
> 2. **Initial Premium** = But you only pay $300 upfront (hoping that's enough)
> 
> 3. **Uncalled Portion** = The remaining $700 you MIGHT have to pay later
> 
> 4. **What triggers paying more?** = If the club has a bad year (lots of claims from other members, not enough money collected), they come back to you and say "Hey, remember that $700 you might owe? We need $400 of it now."
> 
> **Bottom line:** You pay less upfront, but there's a risk they'll ask for more money later if things go badly.

### 2️⃣ Cooperative

**Shareholders are insured and contribute capital. Each shareholder gets ONE vote.**

#### Key Features:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Voting** | Each shareholder = 1 vote |
| **Surplus Distribution** | Paid out based on amounts contributed |
| **Profits** | Dividends or retained in reserves |
| **Premiums** | **NOT assessable based on results** |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** A co-op is like a group project where everyone contributes money and has an equal say (1 person = 1 vote, no matter how much you put in). If there's leftover money at the end, you get your share based on how much you contributed.

#### 💰 The $1M Revenue Example (KEY!):

> 💡 **From Transcript - IMPORTANT EXAMPLE:**
> 
> *"When it comes to liability insurance, a big factor in pricing is your revenues. So if you project or declare $1 million in revenue, they would price your policy based on that.*
> 
> *However, if at the end of the year when you do your renewal, you declare that 'oh, I actually did $1.2 million in revenue' - sometimes they would have what's called an ASSESSMENT PREMIUM. You have to pay that extra money because you did more than anticipated.*
> 
> ***BUT in the case of cooperatives, the premiums are NOT assessable based on results - meaning they do NOT charge you that extra money, even if you underestimated the actual results when you first put the policy in place.***"

> 🎯 **Plain English - The $1M Example Explained:**
> 
> Let's say you run a business:
> 
> 1. **At the start of the year:** You tell the insurance company "I expect to make $1 million this year." They price your insurance based on that.
> 
> 2. **At the end of the year:** Surprise! You actually made $1.2 million (more than expected).
> 
> 3. **With REGULAR insurance:** They say "You made more money than you said, so you were actually a bigger risk. Pay us extra!" (This extra charge = "assessment premium")
> 
> 4. **With a COOPERATIVE:** They say "Nope, we agreed on a price. You made more money? Good for you! We're not charging you extra."
> 
> **Why this matters:** Cooperatives give you price certainty. No surprise bills at the end of the year.

#### Surplus Distribution Example:

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "If I contribute two-thirds towards the cooperative, you contribute one-third to the cooperative - I would be entitled to two-thirds of the surplus."

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If you put in $200 and I put in $100, and at the end of the year there's $30 left over - you get $20 and I get $10. Fair split based on what each person contributed.

### 3️⃣ Factory Mutual

**Focused on providing FIRE insurance and protection**

#### Key Features:

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Focus** | Fire insurance & prevention |
| **Requirements** | Very strict fire protection BEFORE offering insurance |
| **Inspections** | Conduct very detailed inspections |

#### What They Require BEFORE Giving Insurance:

- ✅ Sprinklers
- ✅ Fire systems  
- ✅ Fire alarms
- ✅ All fire prevention measures

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "They might require sprinklers, fire systems, fire alarms, and all these things to prevent fires before they even give you the insurance. Before you can even qualify for the insurance."

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Think of Factory Mutuals as the "strict parents" of fire insurance. They ONLY insure buildings that are REALLY well-protected against fire. Want coverage? First, prove you have sprinklers, alarms, fire systems, everything. They'll send someone to inspect. If you don't meet their standards, no insurance for you. The upside? Because everyone they insure is low-risk, claims are rare and costs are lower.

#### How the Deposit System Works:

```
1. Insured pays a DEPOSIT
   └─ Used to pay: Losses + Expenses + Fund a reserve

2. If there's EXCESS money (from investment income, etc.)
   └─ Insured gets a CREDIT

3. At end of term:
   └─ Deposit is RETURNED or CREDITED towards renewal
```

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Instead of paying a regular premium, you give them a DEPOSIT (like a security deposit for an apartment). They use it to cover any claims. At the end of the year:
> - If there was money left over? You get it back (or it goes toward next year's insurance)
> - If they made money investing your deposit? You get a credit
> 
> It's like a refundable premium.

### 4️⃣ Stock Mutual

**Assessment mutuals that underwent a LEGAL TRANSFORMATION to insure the general public**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Origin** | Started as assessment mutual, then transformed legally |
| **Who They Insure** | Members of the PUBLIC (not just original members) |
| **Premiums** | **FIXED at inception** - not subject to adjustments |

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Premiums for stock mutual companies are fixed at inception and not subject to adjustments, even if the mutual makes or loses money."

> 🎯 **Plain English:** These started as small member-only clubs (assessment mutuals), but then legally changed so they could sell insurance to ANYONE, not just members. 
> 
> **The big benefit:** Your premium is LOCKED IN when you buy. Had a great year? Bad year? Doesn't matter - your price doesn't change. No surprise bills ever.

---

## 🔒 Captive Insurers (Special Type)

**Insurers that are wholly owned and operated by the insureds themselves**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Ownership** | The companies being insured OWN it |
| **Operation** | Like a traditional insurer, putting their own money at risk |
| **Benefit** | They benefit from any profits |
| **Purpose** | Risk financing measure for large related companies |

#### 🛫 Air Canada Example:

> 💡 **From Transcript - REAL EXAMPLE:**
> 
> *"A company like Air Canada, instead of buying insurance from Intact or from another insurance company, they would set up their own insurance company called a captive insurer that's meant to serve only them."*

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Imagine you're SO big (like Air Canada) that instead of paying another company for insurance, you just CREATE YOUR OWN insurance company to insure yourself. 
> 
> **Why would they do this?**
> - They keep all the profit (no paying premiums to Intact who then makes money off you)
> - They control exactly what's covered
> - They can customize everything for their specific needs
> 
> **It's basically:** "Why pay someone else when we can just do it ourselves?"
> 
> **Only works for:** Giant companies with enough money to take on that risk themselves.
