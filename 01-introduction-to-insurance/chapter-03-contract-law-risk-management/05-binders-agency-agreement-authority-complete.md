## 🎯 The Big Picture

> 🎯 **Plain English:** As a broker, you can sometimes say "YES" on behalf of an insurance company without checking with them first - that's called binding authority. But there are rules! This section teaches you what you can and can't bind, how agency agreements work, how you get paid (commissions!), and how to calculate if a book of business is profitable.

## 📝 Part 1: Changing Insurance Contracts

> 💡 **From Transcript (2129s-2140s):** "When it comes to changing an insurance contract, this is usually done via documents, so it has to be done in writing and both parties must agree to it. So there's a couple ways we can do this."

### 4 Ways to Change a Contract:

| Method | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Separate Policy** | For special risks |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Contract Changes):**
> - **Floater**: Coverage for stuff that moves (Handshake with a cell phone).
> - **Rider**: "Add-on" coverage. Like adding cheese to a burger.
> - **Endorsement**: An "Edit." Change the price, the rules, or the names on the paper.

---

### 1️⃣ Floater

> 💡 **From Transcript (2142s-2155s):** "We can issue what's called a floater, which ensures mobile property like cell phones or contractors equipment. Equipment that's off site and goes from place to place as the job requires."

| Floater |
|---------|
| For **mobile property** |
| Goes from place to place |

### 📋 Transcript Examples:

| Mobile Property |
|-----------------|
| Cell phones |
| Contractor's equipment |
| Equipment that travels to job sites |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** A floater "floats" with your stuff wherever it goes!

---

### 2️⃣ Rider

> 💡 **From Transcript (2155s-2167s):** "The next thing we can do is issue a rider. A rider sits on top of an insurance policy, it rides on top and adds coverage. Typically, additional premium would be required because you're getting more coverage."

| Rider |
|-------|
| **Adds coverage** |
| Sits on top of policy |
| Additional premium usually required |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** A rider "rides" on top of your existing policy to give you MORE protection!

---

### 3️⃣ Endorsement

> 💡 **From Transcript (2167s-2183s):** "And lastly, we can issue an endorsement. An endorsement is similar to a rider, but instead of only adding coverage, it makes changes to the policy. So it can be to take something away, it can be to add something, it can be to change the deductible or some kind of term."

| Endorsement |
|-------------|
| **Makes changes** to policy |
| Can add OR remove |
| Can change deductible/terms |

| What Endorsement Can Do |
|------------------------|
| Add coverage |
| Remove coverage |
| Change deductible |
| Modify terms |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** An endorsement is like editing your policy - add, remove, or change anything!

---

### 4️⃣ Separate Policy

> 💡 **From Transcript (2183s-2198s):** "Otherwise, if those three aren't a good fit for you, you can arrange also a separate policy. So this is typical for special risks, such as buildings under construction, automobile fleets or aircraft."

| Separate Policy |
|-----------------|
| For special risks |
| When floater/rider/endorsement don't fit |

### 📋 Transcript Examples:

| Special Risks Needing Separate Policy |
|--------------------------------------|
| Buildings under construction |
| Automobile fleets |
| Aircraft |

---

## 📋 Part 2: Binders

> 💡 **From Transcript (2198s-2237s):** "There's another type of insurance policy called a binder. A binder is an interim policy of insurance. It's issued when a broker commits the insurance company to a contract of insurance without checking with the insurance company first."

### What is a Binder?

| Binder |
|--------|
| Shortcuts the normal process |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Binder):**
> A "Temp Sticker." If you buy a car, sometimes you get a temporary sticker before the real license plate arrives. A binder is a temporary "Yes" that covers you for 30 days while the insurance company finishes the paperwork.

---

### Normal Process vs Binder:

> 💡 **From Transcript (2212s-2237s):** "Typically, what would happen when you purchase an insurance policy is you would fill in an application. The broker then takes this application and sends it off to the insurance company. The insurance company uses the information you gave them to make some decisions, such as whether to insure you or not and how much to charge. With a binder, the broker can shortcut that process and just say yes on behalf of the insurance company."

| Normal Process | Binder |
|----------------|--------|
| Application → Broker → Insurer → Decision | Broker says YES immediately |
| Insurer decides | Broker decides (shortcut!) |

---

### Binder Rules:

> 💡 **From Transcript (2259s-2279s):** "Binders are temporary policies that are issued pending the issuance of the actual policy. If you issue a binder orally, you need to confirm the coverage and limits in writing as soon as possible."

| Binder Rules |
|--------------|
| Temporary - pending actual policy |
| If oral → **confirm in writing ASAP** |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Phone + Email

> 💡 **From Transcript (2271s-2279s):** "So for example, if you're talking on the phone with a client and you say yes, the policy has been bound, you want to follow up with an email right away."

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| On phone with client | Say "yes, it's bound" |
| **Immediately after** | Send email confirming! |

---

### Binder Duration

> 💡 **From Transcript (2443s-2456s):** "And when it comes to binders, they're typically valid for 30 days or when the client receives the policy, whichever comes first."

| Binder Valid Period |
|--------------------|
| **30 days** OR |
| When client receives actual policy |
| **Whichever comes FIRST** |

---

## 🔐 Part 3: Binding Authority

> 💡 **From Transcript (2237s-2256s):** "The agency agreement is what gives the broker authority to commit the insurance company to a contract of insurance. But of course, this is subject to certain limits and conditions. Brokers are not able to bind everything."

### Where Does Binding Authority Come From?

| Source |
|--------|
| Can't bind everything! |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Binding Authority):**
> Your "Spending Limit." The insurance company gives you a credit card (authority). They might say "You can buy normal stuff, but don't buy any private jets without asking me first!"

---

### What You CAN'T Bind:

> 💡 **From Transcript (2250s-2256s):** "For example, they wouldn't be able to bind business that was very high value or very high risk."

| Cannot Bind |
|-------------|
| Very high value |
| Very high risk |

---

### Binding Authority Limits

> 💡 **From Transcript (2293s-2319s):** "The binding authority that you get is subject to certain limits and conditions, so you can't bind everything. For example, your agency agreement might say that you can only bind dwelling and contents that are under $500,000 in limit. So if it's above that, you would have to check with the underwriter first. Or for example, they might force you to check with them for farm risks or certain commercial risks have to be referred to the insurance company for evaluation."

### 📋 Transcript Examples:

| Limit Type | Example |
|------------|---------|
| **Dollar limit** | Dwelling under $500,000 only |
| **Risk type** | Farm risks → must check |
| **Commercial** | Certain risks → refer to insurer |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Your agency agreement might say "you can bind homes up to $500K, but anything bigger needs underwriter approval."

---

### E&O Liability if You Exceed!

> 💡 **From Transcript (2319s-2342s):** "If you exceed your binding authority, the broker can face an E&O claim and can be liable for any losses if the insurance company had to pay for something that they didn't intend to insure in the first place. So your binding authority is defined as your ability to bind coverage as a representative for the insurance company and that's defined through your agency agreement through contract."

| ⚠️ WARNING: Exceeding Binding Authority |
|-----------------------------------------|
| E&O claim against you |
| Liable for losses |
| Insurer didn't intend to cover it! |

---

### Binding Authority Can Change

> 💡 **From Transcript (2350s-2364s):** "Each insurer has their own binding authority, which can be subject to more conditions or loss events. For example, if there's an earthquake, they might temporarily pause binding until the aftershocks have cleared out."

### 📋 Transcript Example: Earthquake Pause

| Scenario | Binding Authority |
|----------|-------------------|
| Normal times | Normal binding rules |
| **After earthquake** | Temporarily PAUSED |
| Why? | Wait for aftershocks to clear |

---

### Policy Different from Application

> 💡 **From Transcript (2364s-2373s):** "If the policy being issued is different from the application, the insurer has two weeks from receiving notice to reject that policy."

| Rule |
|------|
| Policy different from application? |
| Insurer has **2 weeks** to reject |

---

## ✅ Part 4: Express vs Implied Consent

### Express Consent

> 💡 **From Transcript (2373s-2405s):** "So express consent is also known as explicit consent. This is when you were given clear and direct permission either verbally or in writing to do something. So for example, you've signed a form or you have verbally agreed to receiving marketing emails from a company. Maybe you signed up for a service and you checked the box that says that you can receive marketing emails."

| Express Consent |
|-----------------|
| Verbally or in writing |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Express Consent):**
> "Yes, I agree!" You said it out loud or signed your name. There is no doubt about it.

### 📋 Transcript Examples:

| Express Consent Example |
|------------------------|
| Signed a form |
| Verbally agreed |
| Checked box for marketing emails |

---

### Implied Consent

> 💡 **From Transcript (2405s-2443s):** "There's also something called implied consent, also known as inferred consent. This is permission that's assumed based on actions or context. For example, if you make a purchase and you provide your contact information in the process of that, you are providing implied consent that you will be open to further communications, especially about your purchase."

| Implied Consent |
|-----------------|
| Assumed based on actions |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Implied Consent):**
> "It's obvious I agree." If you walk into a store and hand your credit card to the cashier for a shirt, you don't have to say "I consent to you charging me." Your actions show you agree!

### 📋 Transcript Examples:

| Implied Consent Example |
|------------------------|
| Provide contact info during purchase |
| Product recall communications |
| Binding risks outside explicit authority for years with no objection |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Implied Binding Authority

> 💡 **From Transcript (2431s-2443s):** "So an example of implied consent as it applies to brokers is if you've been binding risks outside of the explicit authority for years and no one's ever said anything, then perhaps you have the implied authority to do so."

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Binding outside explicit authority | Not allowed normally |
| Done for years, no complaints | **Implied authority** now exists |

---

## 📋 Part 5: Agency Agreement (5 Sections)

> 💡 **From Transcript (2456s-2475s):** "So brokers are given authority to represent insurance companies through what's called the agency agreements. The agreement varies from insurance company to insurance company and they're typically negotiated separately. You would typically have one agreement with each insurance company you work for and there are five common sections."

### 5 Sections of Agency Agreement:

| # | Section | What It Covers |
|---|---------|----------------|
| 1 | **Broker's Authority** | Risks, limits, binding rules |
| 2 | **Ownership of Expirations** | Who owns the clients |
| 3 | **Billing Procedures** | How to pay premiums |
| 4 | **Commissions** | How you get paid |
| 5 | **Expenses/Termination/Other** | Costs, notice, hold harmless |

---

### Section 1: Broker's Authority

> 💡 **From Transcript (2475s-2484s):** "The first is the broker's authority. This outlines the risks and the limits that you can bind as well as any rules or rate manuals."

| Broker's Authority Section |
|---------------------------|
| Risks you can bind |
| Limits you can bind |
| Rules and rate manuals |

---

### Section 2: Ownership of Expirations

> 💡 **From Transcript (2484s-2494s):** "Next is ownership of expirations. Brokers typically own their clients. However, the insurance company might own those clients if premiums are not remitted on time."

| BUT... insurer can take ownership if premiums not paid on time! |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Ownership of Expirations):**
> This means "Who owns the customer list?" Normally, the Broker owns it. But if the Broker is a deadbeat and doesn't pay the Insurer, the Insurer can take the customers away as payment.

> 🎯 **Plain English:** You own your client list - unless you don't pay the insurer on time. Then they can take your clients!

---

### Section 3: Billing Procedures (4 Methods)

> 💡 **From Transcript (2494s-2597s):** "This also outlines billing procedures. So you need to remit premiums to the insurance company in several different ways."

#### Method 1: Account Current

> 💡 **From Transcript (2502s-2522s):** "The first method is the account current method where the brokerage identifies accounts that are due to the insurance company within a particular time frame. Say during the previous month and then you would write a check or send a payment to the insurance company for those accounts. Usually it's a one month period and most contracts will allow 30 to 60 days to pay."

| Account Current |
|-----------------|
| Brokerage identifies accounts due |
| Sends payment monthly |
| 30-60 days to pay |

---

#### Method 2: Insurer Statement (MOST COMMON!)

> 💡 **From Transcript (2522s-2536s):** "The second method and probably the most common is the insurer statement. Where the insurance company keeps track of the accounts you write with them and the insurance company sends a bill to the brokerage every month typically for the amounts that are due within that time period."

| Insurer Statement |
|-------------------|
| **MOST COMMON** method |
| Insurer tracks accounts |
| Insurer sends bill to brokerage monthly |

---

#### Method 3: Agency Bill

> 💡 **From Transcript (2536s-2575s):** "Agency bill is where the brokerage or the agency will bill the customer, they collect the premiums and then they remit the premiums to the insurer minus the commissions that the brokerage keeps. The problem with this is that clients have to pay all that up front and if they don't want to do that then they would need a lender to help set up a financing plan."

| Agency Bill |
|-------------|
| Brokerage bills client |
| Collects premiums |
| Remits to insurer minus commission |

| Agency Bill Issues |
|-------------------|
| Client pays upfront |
| May need premium financing |
| Broker must manage accounts receivable |
| More admin work |

---

#### Method 4: Direct Bill

> 💡 **From Transcript (2575s-2591s):** "The insurance company bills the clients directly and then they send the broker the commission every month. This is less admin work, but then you get one less touch point with the client. So one less opportunity to interact with them and build that relationship."

| Direct Bill |
|-------------|
| Insurer bills client directly |
| Sends broker commission monthly |

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Less admin work | Less client interaction |
| | Fewer touchpoints |

---

### Premium Financing

> 💡 **From Transcript (2591s-2621s):** "And if the client doesn't want to pay on a lump sum, they can do what's called a premium financing agreement. That's a loan agreement entered into with a third party finance company, usually a specialized premium financing company to pay for the insurance premiums. Essentially they borrow money from the premium financing company and they repay the company in loan instalments over time, often with interest and fees."

| Premium Financing |
|-------------------|
| Loan from third-party company |
| Pay insurance premiums |
| Repay in instalments |
| Interest and fees apply |

---

### Section 4: Commissions

> 💡 **From Transcript (2621s-2654s):** "So the third major section of the agency agreement talks about commissions. Commissions generally range from 10 to 20% of premiums and outside of commissions which is going to be your main mode of compensation, you can also receive something called contingent profits or bonuses that would depend on performance or the loss ratio of the book of business you have with that insurance company."

| Commissions |
|-------------|
| **10-20% of premiums** |
| Main compensation method |

| Contingent Profits/Bonuses |
|---------------------------|
| Low losses = bonus! |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Commissions & Bonuses):**
> - **Commission**: Your basic pay (usually 10-20% of the sale).
> - **Contingent Profit**: A "Good Behavior Bonus." If your customers are careful and don't crash their cars, the insurance company gives you a slice of the profit!

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If your clients don't file many claims (profitable book), the insurer shares some profit with you!

---

## 📊 Part 6: Loss Ratio Calculation

> 💡 **From Transcript (2654s-2674s):** "So let's talk about what loss ratio is. A loss ratio represents the portion of money an insurer pays out in claims compared to the total amount of money they collect in premiums. So the loss ratio is essentially the dollar value of their losses divided by the dollar value of their earned premiums times 100 to get the percentage."

### Loss Ratio Formula:

| Formula |
|---------|
| **Loss Ratio = (Losses ÷ Earned Premiums) × 100** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Loss Ratio):**
> "Claims vs Cash." If you collected $100 and paid out $40 in claims, your ratio is 40%. It shows how much of the customer's money went back out the door for accidents.

---

### 📋 Transcript Example: Loss Ratio Calculation

> 💡 **From Transcript (2674s-2687s):** "So if insurance company B earns 2 million in premiums and they pay $800,000 to settle claims that year, the loss ratio would be $800,000 divided by 2 million times 100, in this case 40%."

| Example |
|---------|
| Premiums Earned: $2,000,000 |
| Claims Paid: $800,000 |
| Loss Ratio: $800,000 ÷ $2,000,000 × 100 = **40%** |

```
LOSS RATIO CALCULATION:

Premiums: $2,000,000
Claims:   $800,000

Loss Ratio = $800,000 ÷ $2,000,000 × 100
           = 0.40 × 100
           = 40%
```

> 🎯 **Plain English:** For every $1 in premiums, they paid out 40 cents in claims. That's good!

---

## 📊 Part 7: Combined Ratio Calculation

> 💡 **From Transcript (2687s-2728s):** "There's also something called the combined ratio that they look at. The formula for combined ratio is the total claims cost plus the expenses incurred divided by the earned premium and then also times 100 to get the percentage. This combined ratio is important because it gives an accurate picture of the company's overall financial health. If the ratio is over 100%, that means the insurers are incurring an underwriting loss."

### Combined Ratio Formula:

| Formula |
|---------|
| **Combined Ratio = ((Claims + Expenses) ÷ Earned Premiums) × 100** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Combined Ratio):**
> "Total Bills vs Cash." This includes the claims **AND** the rent, salaries, and light bills. If this is 100%, you made zero profit. If it's over 100%, you are losing money!

---

### Expenses Included:

> 💡 **From Transcript (2701s-2713s):** "So expenses that are factored in here would include employee salaries, commissions paid to brokers, rent, utilities, legal expenses and all the things that are involved with running an insurance company."

| Expenses in Combined Ratio |
|---------------------------|
| Employee salaries |
| Broker commissions |
| Rent |
| Utilities |
| Legal expenses |
| All operating costs |

---

### What Combined Ratio Tells You:

| Combined Ratio | Meaning |
|----------------|---------|
| **Under 100%** | Profitable! |
| **Over 100%** | Underwriting LOSS |

---

### 📋 Transcript Example: Combined Ratio Calculation

> 💡 **From Transcript (2737s-2759s):** "So let's do another example. If company B incurred expenses of $300,000, right? The same company from before, $800,000 claims, $300,000 in expenses, the combined ratio would be $800,000 plus $300,000 divided by 2 million times 100. In this case, the combined ratio is 55%."

| Example |
|---------|
| Premiums: $2,000,000 |
| Claims: $800,000 |
| Expenses: $300,000 |
| Combined Ratio: ($800K + $300K) ÷ $2M × 100 = **55%** |

```
COMBINED RATIO CALCULATION:

Premiums: $2,000,000
Claims:   $800,000
Expenses: $300,000

Combined Ratio = ($800,000 + $300,000) ÷ $2,000,000 × 100
               = $1,100,000 ÷ $2,000,000 × 100
               = 0.55 × 100
               = 55% (PROFITABLE!)
```

---

### Section 5: Expenses, Termination, Other

> 💡 **From Transcript (2759s-2800s):** "The expenses section basically outlines that brokers have to pay their own expenses, but insurers might share certain costs like advertising because it benefits both parties. Next is termination. You usually have to give 90 to 180 days notice before terminating the contract. And finally, other provisions. These might include clauses that hold the broker harmless against the insurer's mistakes and vice versa."

| Section | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Expenses** | Broker pays own expenses, insurer may share advertising |
| **Termination** | 90-180 days notice required |
| **Other Provisions** | Hold harmless clauses, indemnify for mistakes |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Hold Harmless

> 💡 **From Transcript (2783s-2800s):** "So if the insurer makes a mistake, they're required to indemnify the broker. If the broker makes a mistake, they are required to indemnify the insurer. An example of this would be a violation of your binding agreement."

| If... | Then... |
|-------|---------|
| Broker makes mistake | Broker indemnifies insurer |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Hold Harmless):**
> "I've got your back (if I messed up)." If the insurance company makes a mistake on the paper, they will pay for it so the broker doesn't get sued. If the broker makes the mistake, the broker pays.
