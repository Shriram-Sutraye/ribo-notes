## 🏗️ Contractors Insurance Overview (23:01)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1381.74s-1404.06s):** "When it comes to contractors their business is a little bit different and so they need some different insurance policies. Typically when it comes to contractors insurance policies, their premium is based on annual revenues. So you would typically be charged a provisional premium at the inception of the policy but it can be adjusted at the completion of the policy or the expiry of the policy based on the receipts or the actual values."

| Contractors Insurance |
|----------------------|
| Premium based on annual revenues |
| Provisional premium at inception |
| Adjusted at policy expiry based on actual receipts |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Contractors earn different amounts each year. So instead of a fixed premium, you pay an ESTIMATE at the start. At the end of the year, they look at your actual earnings and adjust the premium up or down.

## 🏗️ Builders Risk / Course of Construction (23:24 - 26:14)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1404s):** Bought by building owner or general contractor to ensure buildings in course of construction.

### What It Covers
| Coverage |
|----------|
| Materials owned by insured (will form part of project) |
| Landscaping & temporary buildings |
| The structure while being built |

### What It Excludes
| Excludes |
|----------|
| Tools & equipment |
| Cost of making good faulty materials/workmanship/design |
| BUT resultant damage IS covered |

### 📋 Example: Faulty Framing
> Poor workmanship causes framing to collapse. **Resultant damage = covered**, but cost to redo the framing correctly = NOT covered.

> [!TIP] **Plain Dumb Down:** Building collapses because of bad work? Insurance pays for the damage. But you pay to FIX the bad work.

---

### Policy Period & Limits

> 💡 **From Transcript (1467.42s-1485.1s):** "When it comes to COCs or course of construction policies the limit of insurance is equal to the completed value of the construction. The policy period starts when the construction starts and ends when the building is occupied or left unattended for over 30 consecutive days."

| Feature |
|---------|
| Limit = completed value of construction |
| Starts: when construction starts |
| Ends: when building occupied OR left unattended >30 days |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Building will be worth $2 million when done? Your limit = $2M. Coverage starts on Day 1 of construction and ends when someone moves in OR if the site is abandoned for 30+ days.

---

### Premium Structure

> 💡 **From Transcript (1486.3s-1528.46s):** "The premium charge at the inception of the policy is based on the maximum value of any one project including materials and labour and the rates are arranged such that they are low at inception because the building is not really built there's not a lot of value in there... However the rates would be then charged at full value at the completion of the policy."

| Premium Structure |
|------------------|
| Based on max value of one project (materials + labour) |
| Rates LOW at inception (less value to insure) |
| Rates FULL at completion (more value to insure) |
| Must report values at stated times |
| Adjusted within 30 days of completion |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> At the start, it's just a foundation—not much to insure. Cheap rates. By the end, it's a full building—expensive. Insurance knows this and charges accordingly. You report progress along the way.

---

### Per Project vs Blanket

> 💡 **From Transcript (1549.66s-1569.18s):** "COC policies can be done on a per project basis so I have one project I get a COC on that. I have project number 2, I get a COC on that or if I'm a general contractor and I do multiple construction projects concurrently per year, then I can also do them on a blanket basis."

| Per Project | Blanket |
|-------------|---------|
| 1 project = 1 COC policy | Multiple projects = 1 policy |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Building one house? Get one policy. Building 10 houses at the same time? Get a BLANKET policy that covers all 10.

## 🔧 Contractors Equipment Floater (26:14 - 27:32)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1574.54s-1617.58s):** "So what happens if a contractor has some equipment that they take to different job sites and they need to get insured? Because if you remember under a standard commercial property policy it only insures property or equipment that is on the insured premises. If you have tools, generators, things that you go from site to site, you would need to purchase what's called a contractor's equipment floater."

| Equipment Floater |
|------------------|
| Covers movable equipment (backhoes, loaders, power tools) |
| Owned, rented, or controlled by insured |
| Scheduled OR blanket basis |
| 30-day reporting requirement for new equipment |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your excavator goes from Site A to Site B to Site C. Normal insurance only covers it AT your home base. An equipment floater covers it EVERYWHERE—at any job site, on the road, wherever.

---

### Coverage Includes

> 💡 **From Transcript (1629.1s-1652.46s):** "The equipment floater offers some pretty comprehensive coverage you can get it on a broad form or name pair of spaces but it will include things like mechanical or electrical breakdown and the losses caused by extremes in temperature, rust or corrosion, or when you exceed the load limit on certain equipment."

| Coverage Includes |
|------------------|
| Mechanical/electrical breakdown |
| Temperature extremes |
| Rust/corrosion |
| Exceeding load limits |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your backhoe's hydraulics fail in the freezing cold? Covered. Your generator overloads and breaks? Covered. Rust damages your equipment? Covered. This floater is comprehensive!

## 📦 Installation Floater (27:32 - 29:49)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1652s):** For specialized contractors doing installations.

### Coverage Period
| When | Coverage |
|------|----------|
| In transit to job site | ✅ |
| At job site awaiting installation | ✅ |
| During installation | ✅ |
| Until accepted OR insurable interest ceased | ✅ |

### 📋 Example: Glass Installer Story

> 💡 **From Transcript (1681s-1741s):** 

| Stage | Coverage |
|-------|----------|
| 1. Order glass, drive to job site | ✅ In transit |
| 2. Stack of glass awaiting installation | ✅ At job site |
| 3. Glass being installed | ✅ During installation |
| 4. GC signs off, pays you | ❌ Your interest ceased |
| 5. After sign-off | Covered by Builders Risk |

> [!TIP] **Plain Dumb Down:** You're a window installer. From the moment you pick up the glass until the general contractor says "looks good, here's your payment," it's YOUR insurance. After that, it's THEIR Builders Risk policy.

### Exclusions
- Tools & equipment (covered elsewhere)
- Faulty materials/workmanship/design (resultant damage covered)

---

## 🔨 Tool Floater (29:35 - 31:29)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1775s):** Covers tools used off premises on ACV basis.

| Tool Floater |
|--------------|
| Tools used off premises |
| ACV basis |
| Scheduled OR blanket |

### Optional Coverage
- Artificial electricity (power surge)
- **Mysterious disappearance**

> [!IMPORTANT] **Mysterious Disappearance:** Very common for tools to "disappear" from job sites. Push this coverage to every contractor client!

> [!TIP] **Plain Dumb Down:** Your drill "walks away" from the job site. Without mysterious disappearance coverage, you need to prove it was stolen. WITH it, you just say "it's gone" and get paid.
