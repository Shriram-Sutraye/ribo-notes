## 📦 General (P&C) Insurance Categories

**General Insurance** = Property & Casualty Insurance

There are **3 main categories** of general insurance:

### 1️⃣ Automobile Insurance 🚗

- **Largest by volume** - Required by law in Canada
- If you own/drive a car, you **must** have auto insurance

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "If you want to drive a car, you owe the car, you need to buy auto insurance."

### 2️⃣ Property Insurance 🏠

Covers physical property against damage or loss.

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Personal Property** | Your home, condo |
| **Commercial Property** | Commercial buildings, manufacturing facilities, equipment |

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "That encompasses both personal property - so like your personal home, your condo - as well as business property like commercial buildings, manufacturing facilities, equipment."

### 3️⃣ Liability Insurance ⚖️

Protects you if you're **legally responsible** for causing injury or damage to someone else.

- This is the **"casualty"** part of Property & Casualty

> 💡 **Real Example from Transcript:** 
> *"If you operated a store, someone slipped on the wet floor, hit their head - you might have liability for that. Liability insurance would protect you from that if you get sued."*

## 🏛️ Types of Insurers

In Canada, there are **two main types**: Government and Private

---

### 1️⃣ Government Insurance 🏛️

**Compulsory insurance offered by government bodies - you HAVE to buy it (mandatory).**

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| 🏥 Provincial Health Plan | OHIP, MSP |
| 💼 Employment Insurance (EI) | Federal program |
| 🔧 Workers Compensation | WSIB, WorkSafeBC |

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Government insurance is typically compulsory... things like employment insurance (EI), your provincial health plan, workers compensation. All that type of stuff is purchased through a government body and it's typically compulsory - meaning you have to buy it, it's mandatory."

### 2️⃣ Private Companies 🏢

### A) Stock Companies 📈

**Owned by shareholders, profit-oriented, for-profit business**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Ownership** | Shareholders |
| **Objective** | Generate profits for shareholders |
| **Capital Source** | Private funds OR public issuance of stock (list on exchange, get investors) |
| **Profits** | Reinvested to grow business OR paid as dividends to shareholders |

> ✅ **Key Point:** "Private stock companies in Canada write MOST of the insurance policies we have here."

> 🇨🇦 **Canadian Example from Transcript:**
> *"A common example of a stock company is Intact Insurance. You can buy their stock on the TSX and they are owned by shareholders and they are a for-profit business."*

---

### B) Mutual Companies 🤝

**Owned by policyholders (called "members"), NOT profit-oriented**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Ownership** | Policyholders = **Members** |
| **Objective** | Collect just enough premiums to cover losses and operations (just cover costs) |
| **Result** | Typically the **cheapest insurance** |
| **Claims** | Usually most **friendly and lax** when adjusting claims |

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "They're usually the most friendly and lax when it comes to adjusting claims. Oftentimes they'll pay claims that they don't really have to."

#### What Happens with Surplus/Shortfall?

| Situation | What Happens |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Company loses money** | Members **pay extra** to make up the shortfall |
| **Surplus of money** | Paid out to members as dividend, reinvested, OR kept in reserve for a rainy day |

## 📋 4 Types of Mutual Companies (DETAILED)

### 1️⃣ Assessment Mutual

**Every policyholder is a member, together they elect a board of directors.**

#### How It Works:

```
Step 1: Insured signs a PREMIUM NOTE
        └─ Face value = Maximum premium payable

Step 2: Insured pays an INITIAL PREMIUM 
        └─ Just a portion of the premium note

Step 3: IF the mutual doesn't collect enough premiums from other members...
        └─ They ASSESS the insured for the rest of the money
        └─ This remaining amount = "UNCALLED PORTION"
```

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "The insured signs a premium note with a face value that would be equal to the maximum premium payable. The insured pays a portion of that in what they call an initial premium. If the mutual doesn't end up collecting enough premiums from the other members in order to cover all the losses, they might require the insured to pay the rest. So they would assess them for the rest of the money, which is known as the uncalled portion."

### 2️⃣ Cooperative

**Shareholders are insured and contribute capital. Each shareholder gets ONE vote.**

#### Key Features:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Voting** | Each shareholder = 1 vote |
| **Surplus Distribution** | Paid out based on amounts contributed |
| **Profits** | Dividends or retained in reserves |
| **Premiums** | **NOT assessable based on results** |

#### 💰 The $1M Revenue Example (KEY!):

> 💡 **From Transcript - IMPORTANT EXAMPLE:**
> 
> *"When it comes to liability insurance, a big factor in pricing is your revenues. So if you project or declare $1 million in revenue, they would price your policy based on that.*
> 
> *However, if at the end of the year when you do your renewal, you declare that 'oh, I actually did $1.2 million in revenue' - sometimes they would have what's called an ASSESSMENT PREMIUM. You have to pay that extra money because you did more than anticipated.*
> 
> ***BUT in the case of cooperatives, the premiums are NOT assessable based on results - meaning they do NOT charge you that extra money, even if you underestimated the actual results when you first put the policy in place.***"

#### Surplus Distribution Example:

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "If I contribute two-thirds towards the cooperative, you contribute one-third to the cooperative - I would be entitled to two-thirds of the surplus."

### 3️⃣ Factory Mutual

**Focused on providing FIRE insurance and protection**

#### Key Features:

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Focus** | Fire insurance & prevention |

| **Inspections** | Conduct very detailed inspections |

#### What They Require BEFORE Giving Insurance:

- ✅ Sprinklers
- ✅ Fire systems  
- ✅ Fire alarms
- ✅ All fire prevention measures

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "They might require sprinklers, fire systems, fire alarms, and all these things to prevent fires before they even give you the insurance. Before you can even qualify for the insurance."

#### How the Deposit System Works:

```
1. Insured pays a DEPOSIT
   └─ Used to pay: Losses + Expenses + Fund a reserve

2. If there's EXCESS money (from investment income, etc.)
   └─ Insured gets a CREDIT

3. At end of term:
   └─ Deposit is RETURNED or CREDITED towards renewal
```

### 4️⃣ Stock Mutual

**Assessment mutuals that underwent a LEGAL TRANSFORMATION to insure the general public**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Origin** | Started as assessment mutual, then transformed legally |
| **Who They Insure** | Members of the PUBLIC (not just original members) |
| **Premiums** | **FIXED at inception** - not subject to adjustments |

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Premiums for stock mutual companies are fixed at inception and not subject to adjustments, even if the mutual makes or loses money."

## 🔒 Captive Insurers (Special Type)

**Insurers that are wholly owned and operated by the insureds themselves**

| **Ownership** | The companies being insured OWN it |
| **Operation** | Like a traditional insurer, putting their own money at risk |
