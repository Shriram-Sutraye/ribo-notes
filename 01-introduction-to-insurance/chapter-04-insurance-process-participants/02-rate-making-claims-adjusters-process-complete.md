## 🎯 The Big Picture

> 🎯 **Plain English:** After underwriters decide WHO to insure, they need to decide HOW MUCH to charge. This section teaches you how rates are made, what happens when someone files a claim, and what documents are needed for different types of claims.

---

## 📊 Part 1: Rate Making (Setting Prices)

> 💡 **From Transcript (481s-494s):** "The second major thing they do is rate making. So this involves setting prices for different risks. So they would analyze the rates and the premiums to determine the overall cost of insurance for that particular applicant."

### What is Rate Making?

| Determining cost per applicant |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Rate Making):**
> This is just "Price Setting." The insurance company has to figure out how much to charge you (premium) so they have enough money to pay for accidents and still make a profit.

---

### Actuaries Make the Rates

> 💡 **From Transcript (495s-511s):** "The actual making of the rates is done by actuaries, who use calculations and projections based on industry and claims results as well as some projections and outlooks to determine the different rates that they need to charge based on some different factors."

| Actuaries |
|-----------|
| Make the actual rates |
| Use calculations and projections |
| Based on industry data and claims results |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Actuaries):**
> Actuaries are the "Insurance Math Nerds." They look at a mountain of past data to predict the future. Their job is to figure out exactly how much everyone needs to pay so the company doesn't go broke when accidents happen.

---

### Rate Calculation Components

> 💡 **From Transcript (511s-529s):** "They may use a variety of components in their calculation such as urban density, materials used, as well as fire protection. So they might look at how close your nearest fire hydrant is, how close your nearest fire department or fire hall would be, your distance to the nearest body of water or lake."

| Component | What They Check |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Urban density** | City vs rural |
| **Materials used** | Construction type |
| **Fire protection** | Hydrant, fire hall, water source |

### 📋 Transcript Examples: Fire Protection Factors

| Fire Protection Factor |
|-----------------------|
| Distance to nearest **fire hydrant** |
| Distance to nearest **fire department/fire hall** |
| Distance to nearest **body of water or lake** |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If you're close to a fire hydrant and fire hall, your rates are lower. If you're in the middle of nowhere, rates go up!

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Fire Protection):**
> "Help is on the way." If your house burns down, how fast can the fire trucks get there?
> - **Close to Hydrant/Station**: Fast help = Less damage = Cheaper Insurance.
> - **Far away**: Slow help = Total destruction = Expensive Insurance.

---

### Pure Premium

> 💡 **From Transcript (532s-547s):** "From there they calculate what's called a pure premium, which is the base amount of premium required to cover expected losses. From there they can build in operational costs as well as commissions they need to pay out to brokers for selling the insurance policies."

| Pure Premium Formula |
|---------------------|
| **Pure Premium** = Base amount to cover expected losses |
| **+ Operational costs** |
| **+ Broker commissions** |
| **= Final Premium** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Pure Premium):**
> Think of a pizza.
> - **Pure Premium**: The cost of the dough, cheese, and pepperoni. (What's needed just to make the pizza/cover losses).
> - **Operational Costs**: The rent for the store and the electricity.
> - **Commissions**: The tip for the delivery driver.
> - **Final Premium**: What the customer actually pays for the whole thing!

---

### Rate Balance: Too Low vs Too High

> 💡 **From Transcript (547s-569s):** "If the final rates they come out is too low, the insurance company might write too many policies which can lead to a negative balance. They write too many policies at too low of a premium and they're not covering their losses. If the final rate is too high, then the premiums become uncompetitive and they may not be profitable as a result because they can't write enough business."

| Rate | Problem | Result |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Too Low** | Write too many policies | Negative balance, losses not covered |
| **Too High** | Uncompetitive | Can't write enough business |

> 💡 **From Transcript (569s-573s):** "And so the rates need to be adjusted and amended constantly."

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Rates are like Goldilocks - they can't be too high or too low, they need to be JUST RIGHT!

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Rate Balance):**
> - **Too Cheap**: Everyone buys from you (Yay!), but you lose $1 on every sale (Boo!). You go bankrupt.
> - **Too Expensive**: No one buys from you. You have $0 in the bank. You go bankrupt.
> - **Goal**: A price that is fair enough to attract customers but high enough to pay all the bills.

> [!TIP]

> - **Too Expensive**: No one buys from you. You have $0 in the bank. You go bankrupt.
> - **Goal**: A price that is fair enough to attract customers but high enough to pay all the bills.

---

### Location Impact on Rates

> 💡 **From Transcript (573s-588s):** "Your location can also impact your rates. Some places may have a higher risk of things like earthquakes, floods, crime and therefore for those areas they might increase the rates or if you're a safer area decrease the rates."

| Location | Rate Impact |
|----------|-------------|
| High earthquake risk | Higher rates |
| High flood risk | Higher rates |
| High crime risk | Higher rates |
| **Safer area** | Lower rates |

---

## 📋 Part 2: Policy Holder Services

> 💡 **From Transcript (588s-606s):** "And the final job they do is policy holder services, meaning paperwork. So they issue quotes, they issue policies, they process policy changes as well as renewals and cancellations in coordination with the insurance broker."

### Underwriter Policy Holder Services:

| Process cancellations | Ending coverage |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Policy Holder Services):**
> This is "Customer Support." They are the ones typing up the documents, sending out the mail, and pushing the buttons to make your policy official.

---

## 🔍 Part 3: Claims Adjusters

> 💡 **From Transcript (606s-618s):** "So we've talked about brokers and agents, we've talked about underwriters, now let's talk about claims adjusters. Their primary role is to investigate losses, determine the amounts and then how those amounts are to be settled."

### What Do Claims Adjusters Do?

| **Settle** claims |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Claims Adjuster):**
> The "Detective." When you say "My house burned down," they are the ones who come out with a clipboard to see if it really burned down, how it happened, and how much it will cost to fix.

---

### The Claims Process Flow

> 💡 **From Transcript (618s-647s):** "So in terms of the claims process what typically happens is the insured discovers a claim and they report to the broker. The broker collects some information and helps them or the broker directly reports it to the insurance company. The insurance company then assigns a company adjuster to deal with the claim."

| 5. | Insurer assigns **adjuster** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Claims Process):**
> It's a Relay Race:
> 1. You (Runner 1) tell the Broker.
> 2. Broker (Runner 2) tells the Insurance Company.
> 3. Insurance Company (Runner 3) sends the Adjuster to finish the race.

---

### Types of Adjusters

> 💡 **From Transcript (635s-647s):** "They may call upon what's called independent adjusters if any specialized knowledge is required or for losses that are far away in remote areas where the insurance company does not employ an adjuster."

| Adjuster Type | When Used |
|---------------|-----------|
| **Company adjuster** | Normal claims |
| **Independent adjuster** | Specialized knowledge needed |
| | Remote areas |
| | Where insurer has no staff |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Adjuster Types):**
> - **Company Adjuster**: The employee who works at the head office.
> - **Independent Adjuster**: The "Freelancer." If a house burns down in a tiny village 10 hours away, the company won't send an employee. They hire a local freelancer to go check it out for them.

---

## 👔 Part 4: Broker Responsibilities in Claims

> 💡 **From Transcript (647s-679s):** "When it comes to a claim what's the broker's responsibility? So our responsibility as brokers is to determine the status of the claim, monitor the progress and ensure client satisfaction by providing good service, maintaining a good relationship and then advising them on any loss control measures they can do in the future."

### Broker Claims Responsibilities:

| Advise on loss control measures |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Broker's Job in Claims):**
> You are the "Cheerleader" (and also the Coach). You can't approve the claim yourself, but you hold the client's hand, explain what's happening, and make sure the insurance company isn't ignoring them.

---

### Why Good Relationships Matter

> 💡 **From Transcript (665s-689s):** "It's also super important to develop good relationships with clients and industry stakeholders to facilitate the claims process because this can result in retention and good referrals if the client has a smooth and satisfactory claims process. You can enhance your industry knowledge and provide better advocacy and problem solving for your clients."

| Good Relationships Lead To |
|---------------------------|
| **Retention** (keep clients) |
| **Referrals** (new clients) |
| Better advocacy |
| Better problem solving |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Happy claims = happy clients = they stay with you AND refer friends!

---

## 📋 Part 5: Five Steps of Claims Handling

> 💡 **From Transcript (689s-698s):** "When a client makes a claim they expect the claim to be handled promptly and if not they might get upset. So there's five steps really involved in claims handling."

### Step 1: Open the Claims File

> 💡 **From Transcript (698s-706s):** "The first is to open the claims file so in that you get information about the loss and you record it to the insurance company."

| Record to insurance company |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Step 1: Open File):**
> "Start the Clock." You get the frantic phone call from the client and you officially log it into the system so the insurance company knows something happened.

---

### Step 2: Verify Coverage

> 💡 **From Transcript (706s-717s):** "The next step is to verify their coverage. Check if their claim is actually covered. Try not to make any definitive commitments but let them know as soon as possible if something is clearly not covered."

| Tell them ASAP if NOT covered |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Step 2: Verify):**
> "Is this even covered?" Before everyone gets excited, check the policy. If they don't have earthquake coverage and they are calling about an earthquake, tell them NO right away so you don't waste time.

---

### Step 3: Advise the Client

> 💡 **From Transcript (717s-728s):** "The third is to advise the client so provide them information on whether deductibles and how they might impact them with losses small and you might also want to discuss the impact of losses on renewal."

| Step 3: Advise Client |
|----------------------|
| Explain deductibles |
| Impact on small losses |
| **Impact on renewal** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Broker Advice):**
> Your job is to say: "Hey, I know your $500 window is broken, but your deductible is $500. If you claim this, you get $0 back, but your price will go up by $200 next year. Maybe just pay for it yourself?"

---

### Step 4: Submit & Follow Up

> 💡 **From Transcript (728s-741s):** "The fourth step is to submit information to the insurance company and then make a note to follow up and monitor the progress. This ensures good customer service and the client is satisfied with how the claim is handled."

| Ensure satisfaction |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Step 4: Submit):**
> "Hand it off." You gathered the facts, gave the advice, now you send the package to the insurance company so they can do their job (approve and pay).

---

### Step 5: Close the File

> 💡 **From Transcript (783s-795s):** "And finally is to close the file so when a claim has been paid the file is closed. As a good tip you might want to deliver the payment or the check personally to the client to build a stronger relationship. I'm sure they'll be very happy to see you to receive a check."

| Builds stronger relationship |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Step 5: Close):**
> "Show me the money." The claim is paid. If you want to be a superstar, drive the check to the client's house personally. They will love you forever.

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Hand-delivering a check is a power move! The client will LOVE you for it.

---

## 👥 Part 6: Who Handles Claims?

> 💡 **From Transcript (741s-777s):** "Claims handling like the actual handling or payment of the claim and adjusting of the claim can be done by the brokerage, by the insurer, or independent adjusters."

### Three Options for Claims Handling:

| # | Who | Details |
|---|-----|---------|
| 1 | **Brokerage** | Large brokerages (commercial lines) may have staff adjusters |
| 2 | **Insurer** | Company employs adjusters |
| 3 | **Independent** | When staff not available or special knowledge needed |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Brokerage Adjusting

> 💡 **From Transcript (751s-762s):** "When it comes to brokerage adjusting, some large brokerages especially for commercial lines might have staff adjusters on the team as well as authority from the insurance company to pay out certain claims."

| Authority to pay certain claims |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Brokerage Adjusting):**
> Some big brokerages are trusted enough to write checks themselves. It's like a cashier having the authority to give a refund without calling the manager.

---

### Who is the Claimant?

> 💡 **From Transcript (777s-783s):** "The claimant is often the policy holder but it can be any insured in the policy who's making the claim."

| Claimant |
|----------|
| Usually the policy holder |
| Can be ANY insured on policy |

---

### ⚠️ Warning: Too Many Claims

> 💡 **From Transcript (799s-807s):** "They might cancel a client's policy if there are too many losses too fast so make sure you warn your clients about that."

| **Warn your clients!** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Too Many Claims):**
> Insurance is for "Big Bad Accidents," not "Every Little Scratch." If a client claims every tiny thing, the insurer will dump them. Warn them!

---

## 📄 Part 7: Claims Documents Required

> 💡 **From Transcript (806s-817s):** "When it comes to claims processing there are some documents that are required. The specific documents required will vary depending on the insurance that they bought and the loss scenario."

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Documents):**
> "Pics or it didn't happen." You can't just say "My car is broken." You need photos, police reports, and repair estimates. The insurance company needs PROOF before they send cash.

---

### Auto Insurance Claims Documents (8 Items)

> 💡 **From Transcript (817s-840s):** "When it comes to auto insurance typically you would need to fill out a claims form, a police report if required, provide your driver's license, vehicle registration, insurance policy, repair cost estimates, maybe by a contracted body shop that has a relationship with the insurance company, provide any photo of the damage or accident scene, medical reports as well as witness statements."

| # | Auto Document |
|---|---------------|
| 1 | Claims form |
| 2 | Police report (if required) |
| 3 | Driver's license |
| 4 | Vehicle registration |
| 5 | Insurance policy |
| 6 | Repair cost estimates (contracted body shop) |
| 7 | Photos of damage/accident scene |
| 8 | Medical reports + witness statements |

---

### Home Insurance Claims Documents (7 Items)

> 💡 **From Transcript (840s-872s):** "When it comes to home insurance a claims form is needed as well as proof of ownership, a police report in the event of theft or vandalism claims, photos, repair estimates, maybe by the plumber or the service professional that comes to look at it, a copy of the insurance policy, an inventory or list of damaged or stolen items or a water damage report if it's needed."

| # | Home Document |
|---|---------------|
| 1 | Claims form |
| 2 | Proof of ownership |
| 3 | Police report (theft/vandalism) |
| 4 | Photos |
| 5 | Repair estimates (plumber/professional) |
| 6 | Copy of insurance policy |
| 7 | Inventory of damaged/stolen items |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Water Damage Report

> 💡 **From Transcript (863s-875s):** "Typically if you have water damage a plumber will come, they will look at it and inspect and they'll write up a report on what they think happened, that report should be included as part of the claims documentation sent to the insurance company."

| Water Damage |
|--------------|
| Plumber inspects |
| Writes report on what happened |
| Include with claims documentation |

---

### Commercial/Business Insurance Claims Documents (7 Items)

> 💡 **From Transcript (875s-895s):** "Finally when it comes to business insurance or commercial claims you would need a claims form, proof of loss document, police report if necessary, repair estimates, copy of the insurance policy, any financial records if you need to prove for example a business disruption claim, a list of all your inventory as well as photos detailing the damage."

| # | Commercial Document |
|---|---------------------|
| 1 | Claims form |
| 2 | Proof of loss document |
| 3 | Police report (if necessary) |
| 4 | Repair estimates |
| 5 | Copy of insurance policy |
| 6 | Financial records (for business disruption) |
| 7 | Inventory list + photos |

---

## ⚠️ Part 8: Consequences of Making a Claim

> 💡 **From Transcript (895s-930s):** "What are the consequences or implications of making a claim?"

### 4 Claim Consequences:

| # | Consequence | Details |
|---|-------------|---------|
| 1 | **Premium increase** | Can go up for several years |
| 2 | **Lose discounts** | Safe driving, claims-free discounts |
| 3 | **Policy term changes** | Higher deductibles, exclusions added |
| 4 | **Remarketing difficulty** | Hard to shop around |

---

### 📋 Transcript Examples:

> 💡 **From Transcript (898s-905s):** "Well, when you make a claim your premium can go up on renewal, possibly for several years down the line."

> 💡 **From Transcript (905s-911s):** "You might lose discounts, so if you have a safe driving discount or a claims free discount you might lose that."

> 💡 **From Transcript (911s-919s):** "Also changes in the policy terms, they might increase your deductibles or limits or coverages or add exclusions on renewal."

> 💡 **From Transcript (919s-930s):** "And finally remarketing. When a client has had a recent claim it can be very difficult for you to shop the policy around and find more competitive rates or other insurers willing to provide coverage."

| Consequence | Example |
|-------------|---------|
| **Lose discounts** | Safe driving, claims-free |
| **Policy changes** | Higher deductibles, new exclusions |
| **Remarketing** | Can't find other insurers |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Making a claim can hurt you for YEARS - higher premiums, lost discounts, and harder to find new coverage!

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version (Remarketing):**
> Remarketing is "Shopping Around." If you have a fresh claim on your record, other insurance companies will look at you like you're "Bad Luck." Most will say "No thanks," and the few that say "Yes" will charge you a fortune. It's much easier to shop when you have zero claims!
