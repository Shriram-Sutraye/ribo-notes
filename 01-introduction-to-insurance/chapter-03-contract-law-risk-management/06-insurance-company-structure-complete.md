## 🎯 The Big Picture

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Insurance companies have 5 main departments, each with specific jobs. Understanding what each department does helps you know who to contact for different issues and how the industry works behind the scenes.

---

## ⚠️ First: Violating Binding Agreement Consequences

> 💡 **From Transcript (2797s-2812s):** "An example of this would be a violation of your binding agreement. If you bound something that the insurer company did not intend to insure, they might still be obligated to pay out that claim, but they might come back and subrogate against the broker for violating the agency agreement. Violated the binding requirements in that."

### What Happens If You Violate Binding Agreement?

| Step | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| 1. Broker binds unauthorized risk | Exceeds binding authority |
| 2. Insurer pays claim | Still obligated to customer |
| 3. Insurer subrogates | Comes after BROKER for money |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If you bind something you weren't supposed to and there's a claim, the insurer will pay the customer - but then come after YOU for the money!
