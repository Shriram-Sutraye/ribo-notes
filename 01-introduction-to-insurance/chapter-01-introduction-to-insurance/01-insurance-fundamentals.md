## 1️⃣ Definition of Insurance

Insurance is a contract where one party (insurer) agrees to compensate another (insured) for specified losses.

### The 5 Key Elements:

| # | Element | Explanation |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Transfer Risk** | The insured transfers the risk of loss to the insurer |
| 2 | **Promise to Pay** | Insurer promises to pay if a covered loss occurs |
| 3 | **Accidental Losses** | Only covers unexpected, accidental events (not intentional) |
| 4 | **Principle of Indemnity** | Restores the insured to pre-loss position (no profit) |
| 5 | **Money or Repair/Replace** | Payment can be cash, repair, or replacement |

> 💡 **Key Concept:** Insurance is NOT a savings plan — it's risk transfer. You're paying someone else to take on your financial risk.

## 2️⃣ Functions of Insurance

Insurance serves 5 major functions in society:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Spread Risk** | Pools premiums from many to pay losses of few |
| **Loss Prevention/Reduction** | Insurers promote safety (discounts for alarms, sprinklers) |
| **Peace of Mind** | Knowing you're protected reduces worry |
| **Supply Credit** | Banks require insurance before lending (mortgages, car loans) |
| **Source of Jobs & Capital** | Insurance industry employs thousands, invests billions |

### Why Each Matters:

#### Spread Risk
> One person can't afford a $500,000 house fire. But 100,000 people each paying $500/year creates a $50M pool to cover the few who have fires.

#### Supply Credit
> Banks won't give you a mortgage without home insurance — if the house burns down, they need to know their loan is protected!

#### Source of Jobs & Capital (2026 Context)
> Insurance companies invest premiums in bonds, stocks, and real estate. In Ontario alone, the P&C industry employs over 125,000 people.
