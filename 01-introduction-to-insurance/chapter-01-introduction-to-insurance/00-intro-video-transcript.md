`[00:00]` So we're going to start off this course by talking quickly about what insurance is.
`[00:09]` In this section we're basically going to be introducing insurance and some insurance concepts.
`[00:15]` So insurance means an undertaking by one party to indemnify another if a specific parallel damages an object of insurance.
`[00:23]` That means the insurance company will compensate you if a fire damages your house. That's one example.
`[00:30]` So when we look at the insurance industry it serves five main functions in society.
`[00:37]` The first and the main one and the most important function is the spread risk.
`[00:41]` Insurance companies also participate in loss prevention or reduction measures.
`[00:45]` They provide peace of mind.
`[00:47]` They supply credit and they're a source of jobs in capital.
`[00:50]` So the primary function of insurance is the spread risk.
`[00:54]` It spreads risk from the few to the many because as you pay your insurance premiums, they are pulled into the insurance company and all of those funds collectively are used to pay our losses to the few that have them every year.
`[01:08]` The second function of insurance is that insurance companies participate in loss prevention and reduction measures.
`[01:14]` So they do things like send representatives to visit sites to assess and offer suggestions on how to decrease the chances of loss or they form partnerships with communities or other organizations to run nationwide campaigns against things like insurance fraud, traffic safety.
`[01:30]` In sure is also participate in loss prevention and reduction measures.
`[01:34]` For example, they can send representatives to visit their client sites to assess the risk factors there and offer suggestions to decrease the chance of loss or they partner with communities and other organizations to run campaigns against things like insurance fraud or traffic safety.
`[01:50]` Third, they offer peace of mind.
`[01:51]` When you buy insurance in eliminates worry and lets people take risk.
`[01:55]` It's easier to take the risk of starting a business when you know that you can buy insurance and have a risk of fire or theft or any cash traffic events protected.
`[02:04]` You can pay a small fixed amount every year to fend off an unknown large claim.
`[02:11]` Fourth, they supply credit.
`[02:13]` Oftentimes, lenders won't lend for a property that is not insured.
`[02:17]` If you want to buy a house and take out a mortgage, the bank is not going to give you a mortgage if you don't have insurance on that home because they need to know if something happens, they can get paid.
`[02:26]` And lastly, they are a source of jobs and capital.
`[02:29]` Of course insurance companies hire people and they also invest their insurance premiums into the market.
`[02:35]` There's also something important you need to know here called the insurance rate, which is the cost of insurance per unit of exposure.
`[02:43]` So for example, a building rate of $2 per thousand dollars of coverage, meaning to ensure a building that's $100,000, it will cost $200.
`[02:56]` So let's talk about the definition of insurance.
`[02:59]` So there's really five parts to the definition of insurance.
`[03:02]` The first part is that it's an agreement between the insurance company and the insured to transfer a risk.
`[03:08]` It's a contract that allows the insured to transfer a risk to the insurance company.
`[03:12]` If anything happens, it's the insurance company that has to pay.
`[03:16]` The second point is that the insurance company promises to pay, where a specific peril damages an object of insurance, just like we discussed previously, or when the insured causes lost to other people.
`[03:27]` That's called liability insurance, which we'll discuss later on.
`[03:31]` Insurance will also only pay for accidental losses that happen after the agreement starts.
`[03:37]` That means there's no coverage for things that happen to before you bought insurance.
`[03:40]` And there's no coverage for things that you do on purpose.
`[03:44]` The fourth component is the principle of indemnity.
`[03:47]` The principle of indemnity states that the amount of payment you get for a claim is equal to the amount of loss based on the value of the object immediately prior to loss.
`[03:57]` So that means there's depreciation and a bunch of different factors that go into it. We'll talk more about this in detail later on.
`[04:03]` And the fifth component is that payment can be in the form of money or other things, such as repairing or placing your property.
`[04:10]` So the insurance company has the choice when they lost a curse to give you cash or simply to pay to get your property repair or replaced.
`[04:21]` Now let's talk about the different types of insurance.
`[04:24]` So the type of insurance that we're training for is called general insurance. Sometimes also called property and casualty insurance.
`[04:30]` And there's three main categories. First you have auto insurance.
`[04:34]` Auto insurance is the largest by volume because it's required by law.
`[04:37]` If you want to drive a car, you owe the car you need to buy auto insurance.
`[04:41]` The second biggest and most popular is property insurance.
`[04:45]` And that encompasses both personal property (so like your personal home, your condo) as well as business property (like commercial buildings, manufacturing facilities, equipment, all of that falls under property).
`[04:57]` And lastly we have liability.
`[04:59]` Lability insurance provides you protection if you're found legally responsible for causing injury or damage to a third party.
`[05:05]` So that's the casualty part of property and casualty.
`[05:09]` So an example of liability insurance would be if you operated a store, some of these lifted fell on the wet floor, hit their heads. You might have liability for that.
`[05:17]` And so the source liability insurance would protect you from that if you get sued.
`[05:22]` Next let's talk about the different types of insurers.
`[05:25]` In Canada we have two main types: We have private insurance and we have government insurance.
`[05:31]` So government insurance is typically compulsory. And it's offered by the government.
`[05:35]` So it would be things like employment insurance (EI), your provincial health plan, workers compensation.
`[05:41]` All that type of stuff is purchased through a government body. And it's typically compulsory, meaning you have to buy it. It's mandatory.
`[05:50]` The second type is private insurance. So these are offered by private entities.
`[05:54]` They can be stock companies, which are companies are owned by shareholders and profit oriented. So they're more of a for-profit business.
`[06:02]` The money that they have is derived from private funds or public issuance of stock.
`[06:07]` So maybe they get money from investors. They list on a public exchange. And they get money that way.
`[06:13]` And the profits are either reinvested to grow the business or they're paid out as dividends to the shareholders.
`[06:20]` Private stock companies in Canada right most of the insurance policies we have here.
`[06:24]` And they're usually licensed to transact business in most provinces.
`[06:28]` So common example of a stock company is intact insurance. You can buy their stock on the TSX and they are owned by shareholders and they are a for-profit business.
`[06:37]` The second type you can get is called a mutual company.
`[06:40]` These are companies that are owned by policy holders. And so they're not really called policy holders; they're called members.
`[06:45]` And they're not profit oriented. Their goal is to collect just enough premiums to cover losses and operations. So just to cover their costs.
`[06:54]` So typically this would result in the cheapest insurance.
`[06:57]` And they're usually the most friendly and lax when it comes to adjusting claims. Oftentimes they'll pay claims that they don't really have to.
`[07:04]` If the company loses money, the policy holders or the members need to pay money to make up that shortfall.
`[07:10]` Or if there's a surplus of money, then that is paid out to the policy holders or members as a dividend, it can be reinvested or it can be kept in reserve for a rainy day.
`[07:20]` When it comes to mutual companies, there are four types.
`[07:23]` You have an assessment mutual, where every policy holder is a member and together they elect a board of directors.
`[07:29]` So what happens here is that the insured signs a premium note with a face value that would be equal to the maximum premium payable.
`[07:37]` The insured pays a portion of that in what they call an initial premium.
`[07:42]` If the mutual doesn't end up collecting enough premiums from the other members in order to cover all the losses, they might require the insured to pay the rest.
`[07:50]` So they would assess them for the rest of the money, which is known as the uncalled portion.
`[07:56]` The second type is a cooperative, where shareholders are insured and they contribute capital.
`[08:03]` So each shareholder gets one vote and any surplus money is paid out based on the amounts contributed.
`[08:09]` So if I contribute two thirds towards the cooperative, you contribute one third to the cooperative, I would be entitled to two thirds of the surplus.
`[08:17]` And profits are paid out as dividends or retained in reserves for a rainy day.
`[08:22]` Premiums are not accessible based on results, meaning they don't change based on the actual versus projected results.
`[08:30]` So for example, when it comes to liability insurance, a big factor when it comes to pricing your liability insurance is your revenues.
`[08:38]` So if you project or you declare a million dollars in revenue, they would price your policy based on that.
`[08:44]` However, if at the end of the year when you do your renewal, you declare that oh, I actually did 1.2 million in revenue, sometimes they would have what's called an assessment premium.
`[08:52]` So you have to pay that extra money because you actually did more than when you anticipated.
`[08:59]` But in a case of cooperatives, the premiums are not accessible based on results, meaning they do not charge you that extra money, even if you underestimated the actual results when you first put the policy in place.
`[09:11]` The third type is a factory mutual. These are focused on providing fire insurance and protection.
`[09:17]` So usually they would require some really strict fire protection be in place before offering you the insurance and they would conduct a very detailed inspections.
`[09:25]` So they might require sprinklers, fire systems, fire alarms, and all these things to prevent fires before they even give you the insurance.
`[09:33]` Before you can even qualify for the insurance.
`[09:37]` So insurance pay a deposit that's used to pay losses, expenses, and funds a reserve.
`[09:43]` If there's excess money back due to investment income or other factors, they would get a credit.
`[09:49]` At the end of the term, the deposit is either returned or credited towards a renewal.
`[09:55]` And lastly, we have stock mutual companies. These are assessment mutual companies that underwent a legal transformation to let them ensure members of the public.
`[10:04]` Premiums for stock mutual companies are fixed at inception and not subject to adjustments, even if the mutual makes or loses money.
`[10:13]` And finally, we have a special type called a captive insure.
`[10:16]` These are where insures are wholly owned and operated by the insures.
`[10:21]` They operate like a traditional insure, putting their own money at risk, and benefiting from any profits.
`[10:26]` So this is usually set up as a risk financing measure to ensure a group of large related companies.
`[10:33]` So a company like Air Canada, instead of buying insurance from intact or from another insurance company, they would set up their own insurance company called a captive insure that's meant to serve only them.
`[10:44]` When it comes to cooperative mutual insurance companies, the premiums are not accessible based on results.
`[10:55]` So now that we've talked about what insurance is and the different types of insurance companies, let's talk about the ways insurance is distributed here in Canada.
`[11:04]` So there are two main ways insurance is sold: We have direct right and we have independent broker.
`[11:11]` So with the direct writer system, the insurance company sells its own products direct to consumer.
`[11:15]` So that means the insurance company has its own sales force selling its own products, but any clients brought in by the salesman belongs to the insurance company.
`[11:26]` The second type is the independent broker. So the broker represents more than one insurance company and they get paid via commissions.
`[11:34]` Any clients brought in by the broker belong to the broker.
`[11:38]` And the third sort of bonus method is the agency system.
`[11:42]` So with the agency system, all the agents are considered small business owners.
`[11:47]` So agents get paid via commissions and they own their own book of business.
`[11:51]` But typically, they only represent one insurance company as well as the facility association.
`[11:56]` And we'll talk about what the FAS layer. Examples of an agency system would be state farm or co-operators.
`[12:06]` Another way insurance is distributed is through MGA's or managing general agents.
`[12:12]` These are essentially wholesalers or intermediaries between insurance and brokers.
`[12:17]` So MGs have certain powers like underwriting abilities, they can settle claim sometimes and even appoint brokerages to sell their products.
`[12:25]` They usually have some specialized expertise or access to some specialized products, typically in the E&O or professional liability space.
`[12:35]` MGA's can be structured as an independent brokerage or an independent agency.
`[12:39]` So as an independent brokerage, they operate as a standalone business that sells insurance policies from two or more insurance companies.
`[12:46]` They receive commissions from insurance companies when their policies are sold.
`[12:50]` And every working member of an MGA must have a broker's license just like a regular broker.
`[12:55]` Otherwise, they can also be set up as independent agencies, which are also standalone businesses but they can only sell insurance from one company.
`[13:03]` These are typically owned by one or more individual agents.
`[13:06]` They earn a commission from their partner to ensure and they own their own book of business.
`[13:12]` MGA's can also deal directly with clients provided the staff have the appropriate licensing, similar to a regular broker.
`[13:19]` So the reason why MGA's exists as wholesalers is because oftentimes if you don't have enough volume, insurance companies are not going to give you contracts to sell their policies.
`[13:29]` So you can access those same ensures through MGA's who act as wholesalers to aggregate demand.
`[13:36]` So if one broker doesn't have enough business, one MGA can sell to five brokerages and together those five will have enough volume to provide the insurance company.
`[13:45]` Another way to procure insurance is to a market called Lloyds of London, which you may have heard of before.
`[13:50]` Their role is typically to ensure the stuff that is uninsurable in normal markets.
`[13:55]` So through Lloyds of London, you can ensure all kinds of stuff: Battle ships, cruise ships, satellites, they ensure all the weird stuff.
`[14:05]` But they're not actually an insurance company. They're actually a group of underwriters who assume risk for themselves.
`[14:11]` Anyone can be a Lloyds underwriter as long as they meet the financial requirements.
`[14:16]` Lloyds underwriters use coverholders to provide a broader scope of coverage, more efficiency, and market expansion.
`[14:21]` Coverholders are basically independent companies worldwide that are authorized by Lloyds syndicates to underwrite contracts.
`[14:29]` This allows Lloyds syndicates to operate globally on a more cost-effective basis, and the coverholders are authorized to issue documents, bind coverage, collect premiums, settle claims, and write business within tight limits called delegated authority.
`[14:44]` A syndicate is actually a group of underwriters. So the underwriting agent manages the syndicate and appoints, who's called a lead underwriter, who is an expert in that class of business.
`[14:55]` So if you put a syndicate together to write directors and officers insurance, the lead underwriter would be an expert in that type of insurance.
`[15:03]` And the syndicate would then grant delegated authority to different coverholders to then distribute their insurance products into the marketplace.
`[15:13]` There's also a concept called a subscription policy. A subscription policy exists when there's one or more syndicate or one or more insurance company participating in an insurance contract.
`[15:24]` This is useful because sometimes a risk is too big for one syndicate or one insurer to take on.
`[15:31]` Let's say you want to ensure a tower valued at $100 million. It'll be very rare to find one insurance company willing to risk $100 million in one insurance policy.
`[15:42]` And so they might say, okay, I want to ensure this property, but I only want to ensure 20% of it.
`[15:48]` So you have a 20% subscribed and you need to find other syndicates or other insurers to take on the rest of the risk.
`[15:53]` So each syndicate would sign a slip under the lead insurer.
`[15:59]` The lead insurer is the one that takes a greatest percentage of the policy and everyone else subscribes to that policy.
`[16:03]` You can also get what's called a manuscript policy. So these are tailor-made policies that are in specifically for a complex or unique risk.
`[16:13]` So it's almost like a custom insurance policy. All policy holders and subscribers of a manuscript policy, if there are subscribers, must agree to all terms of that policy.
`[16:24]` In terms of the process of placing business with loads of London, somebody called a producer, so almost like the sales person, will provide a broker with underwriting information on a slip.
`[16:33]` So the slip would be sort of the application. Underwriters will look at it and they will either decline it or accept it.
`[16:41]` Underwriters will commit to a percentage of the risk until the policy is fully subscribed.
`[16:45]` Sometimes one unwriter takes 100% of the risk and you're done.
`[16:51]` So once the slip or the application is fully subscribed, it is then sent to the Lloyd's policy signing office to make an official.
`[17:03]` Another important concept to understand is re-insurance.
`[17:04]` Re-insurance is when one insurer, in this case called the re-insured, seats the risk to another insurer, the re-insurer.
`[17:16]` Basically re-insurance is when an insurance company buys insurance on an insurance policy that they wrote or a portfolio of insurance policies that they read.
`[17:22]` What it does is similar to what it does for a regular person. It allows the insurance company to re-insure or pass on or transfer some of the loss exposure to another party.
`[17:33]` So this allows them to stabilize the ups and the downs due to frequency or severity of losses.
`[17:40]` What it does is it allows the insurance company to stabilize the ups and downs they might see due to high frequency or high severity of losses.
`[17:51]` There's a key term you need to know here called Retro Session, which is when a re-insurer seats the risk again to another person, the Retro Session Nair.
`[18:03]` So that means the re-insurance company buys re-insurance on the re-insurance policy they just wrote if that makes sense.
`[18:08]` So acquiring re-insurance is usually done by the insurance companies and the underwriters, so it's not typically something that brokers or agents even know about.
`[18:20]` But why is re-insurance used? What are the benefits of re-insurance?
`[18:20]` The first benefit is that it increases capacity, meaning it increases the amount of coverage that the insurance company can take on.
`[18:24]` Maybe they don't want to have 5 million tied up in one risk. Maybe an insurance company doesn't want to tie up 5 million in ensuring one risk.
`[18:30]` So what they might do is re-insure 4 million of it so it frees up that capacity so they can write other business.
`[18:35]` Essentially it takes some risk off their books so then they can write more business.
`[18:47]` The second is to preserve their premium reserve ratio.
`[18:54]` There are rules that say that they can't write more business than a certain multiple of the cash or liquid assets that they hold.
`[19:00]` So again they use re-insurance to get some of the money off their books so they can write more business and write more policies.
`[19:05]` Premium capacity is defined as the amount and insurance company can safely write based on some general accounting principles and also the Insurance Act.
`[19:16]` It lets insurers offload some contractual obligations to their re-insurance to again open them capacity to write more business.
`[19:22]` It also offers catastrophe protection from things like natural disasters.
`[19:26]` Certain catastrophic events can cause insurance companies to pay huge sums of money and potentially go bankrupt.
`[19:31]` So they use re-insurance or retrocession to spread that risk to prevent a big catastrophic event from taking them out.
`[19:37]` Similar to how a regular person might use insurance.
`[19:43]` They might also use re-insurance when they're leaving a class of business.
`[19:49]` If you don't want to write a particular class of business anymore say restaurants for example and you want to get those liability off your books you can just re-insure your entire portfolio of restaurant insurance policies instead of canceling those customers.
`[20:00]` So you just re-insure all of their way that freeze up your capacity you're no longer exposed to the risk of restaurants and you can write other business.
`[20:14]` So there are four different types of re-insurance contracts and they vary based on the way they're placed and the way premiums and losses are shared.
`[20:19]` So the first is treaty re-insurance where it covers all policies within a particular class.
`[20:25]` So let's say restaurants you can arrange a treaty re-insurance policy for restaurants and all restaurants that you write are covered by this treaty re-insurance policy.
`[20:35]` The second is called Facultative Reinsurance. This is arranged separately for each policy.
`[20:42]` So let's say you write a particularly large policy to ensure a skyscraper. You might want to arrange special re-insurance just for that one policy.
`[20:48]` The third type is called a proportional re-insurance where all of the business is re-insured and you share all losses and premiums based on a percentage split.
`[21:00]` So this helps you balance the frequency and severity of losses.
`[21:06]` So let's say I have a hundred million dollar insurance portfolio of various risks. I have homes I have businesses, I have buildings, I have boats, all kinds of stuff.
`[21:17]` I can arrange what's called a proportional re-insurance policy on a 50-50 split.
`[21:24]` So when I receive premiums half of that goes to the re-insurance company and when I pay losses half of that is paid by the re-insurance company.
`[21:30]` And finally we have what's called non-proportional re-insurance. This is the most common where basically the re-insurance company would pay losses above a certain dollar value.
`[21:40]` And so this can be based on a per-risk basis based on a pair of such as earthquake: I want to re-insure all of my earthquake losses above a hundred million dollars or based on a portfolio of business.
`[21:50]` So this case the retention limit is how much the insurance company is responsible for.
`[21:55]` So it's almost like a deductible for re-insurance policy.
`[22:01]` The benefit of non-proportional re-insurance is it helps limit the severity of loss by the insure.
`[22:07]` Because if I arrange it for all losses above a hundred million dollars, I know that the maximum I can pay is a hundred million.
`[22:11]` Anything additional de-re-insurance company would be responsible for.
`[22:14]` So let's use an example. Let's say I'm an insurance company and I enter into a non-proportional re-insurance agreement.
`[22:20]` I agree to retain up to three million dollars for wildfire claims in Ontario.
`[22:25]` I would pay a fee to the re-insurance company for this coverage over a set period of time say annually.
`[22:30]` So that summer if wildfires cost ten million dollars in losses and my retention limit is three million, I'm only required to pay the first three million in claims and the re-insurance company would cover the remaining seven million.
`[22:42]` So it helps me cap my exposure or cap and limit my risk at three million dollars. Whatever my retention limit is.
`[22:52]` So when it comes to purchasing insurance, there's a couple steps in the process.
`[23:00]` Let's talk about new business and how that's done.
`[23:00]` So step one, we always want to make sure that we greet the client professionally, whoever's taking their application, whoever the customer service rep is, they need to greet the customer professionally.
`[23:11]` You need to ask questions in order to understand their needs. This is called a needs assessment.
`[23:17]` If you think there's something missing, you should prime, you should ask more questions.
`[23:22]` And from there you can identify the companies that are likely to ensure them based on their needs and the products that they require.
`[23:31]` From there you can send to the appropriate application to the client for them to fill out.
`[23:36]` Consent is required before moving the process along. So this can be either expressed or implied consent which we're going to discuss later.
`[23:42]` The consent is required to use their information for privacy reasons and so forth.
`[23:48]` If they have some specific risks or special sort of circumstances, you might need specific applications for certain products.
`[23:54]` For example, if they have a home-based business, there might be an additional application you need to complete for that.
`[24:04]` Applicants and brokers have a duty to disclose all material facts and make accurate representations.
`[24:11]` The ensure relies on this and if any information given is false or intentionally omitted, this can lead to avoid policies and denied claims. So not good.
`[24:22]` Applications can be taken orally or in writing.
`[24:23]` When it comes to oral applications, you need to make sure you take written notes.
`[24:27]` You need to outline what we talked about who you talked to and when you talked about it.
`[24:33]` If it's over the phone, maybe you need to record the calls and keep these records properly.
`[24:37]` So meaning you uploaded to your brokerage management system or you file it away somehow and also send written confirmation to the client of anything that you discussed.
`[24:48]` If you take the application in writing, brokers can use either their own or the ensures application forms.
`[24:55]` CSIL also provides standardized applications that you can use for certain common businesses or common risks like home insurance.
`[25:01]` So the advantage of course of taking a written application is that it's the most accurate, especially if the client reviews and signs it.
`[25:10]` The application also serves as a checklist to make sure you're asking all the right questions.
`[25:16]` It also gives coverage and risk management recommendations.
`[25:17]` For example, it might include a section on cyber insurance or have questions related to cyber security measures.
`[25:22]` If you're not able to take yes to certain cyber security measures, maybe that's something you need to investigate and something that you should invest in putting - for example, commonly backups.
`[25:32]` If you're looking to get cyber insurance and you take note to the question of, "Do you back up your data?", this might be something you want to do.
`[25:43]` It also helps prevent errors because there's no risk of making a mistake while you're transcribing the information or entering the information again.
`[25:53]` The applications can also be used as evidence of coverage and proof that you've asked all the right questions.
`[25:59]` It also results in better service for the customer because you get all the information upfront and there's less back and forth.
`[26:04]` A lot of applications also have a legal and privacy disclosure in them. So in the client signs it, they're also agreeing to those legal and privacy disclosures.
`[26:14]` And remember to include notices about false or misleading statements and the repercussions of this to prevent insurance fraud.
`[26:19]` Usually on the insurance applications, they'll have a little section on the bottom about that.
`[26:23]` So again, it makes it really, really easy for you to fill all your requirements when you use a written application.
`[26:37]` So now we're going to talk about the types of information that might be generally required for an insurance application.
`[16:42]` If you need something very specific or there's a niche risk, there's usually more specialized questions that are required, but in general, this is what we need.
`[26:52]` So we need the name of the named insured, which is the applicant.
`[26:57]` We also need their mailing address in case they need to receive policy documents or notices related to the insurance policy.
`[27:03]` Also, lost payees. A lost payee is somebody other than the named insured who can collect money.
`[27:08]` If there's a lot of lost payees, you need to investigate because that could be a potential moral hazard.
`[27:14]` For example, if you have a lot of mortgages or debtors that are listed on the policy, maybe there's a lot of debt on there, which could indicate that insured might be suffering from financial difficulties, which means there's a higher risk of insurance fraud or neglecting the maintenance.
`[27:29]` Next, we also need the subject of insurance. What are we insured? Is it a home car? Is it liability? Is it a piece of business equipment?
`[27:40]` What limit of insurance is required? What coverage is a required?
`[27:45]` When it comes to property, you need to know what we're insuring, where is it? What limits are required and what's the usage? (Are you living in it? Is it a rental property? What are we doing here?)
`[27:54]` When it comes to auto insurance, you need to have a description of the automobile, the territory of operation, usage, (so is it for business or personal use), who drives it, and who has insurable interest?
`[28:01]` So the owner might have insurable interest if it's a least vehicle or a financed vehicle, then the seller may also have some insurable interest, right? (The leasing company or the lending company).
`[28:11]` You also need to know the policy term. When does the policy start? When does it end?
`[28:16]` Typically policies are for a one-year term, and you can sometimes backdate the inception of the policy, but that requires some detailed investigation, because you cannot provide coverage or something that already happened, right?
`[28:25]` You cannot buy fire insurance on a house while it's on fire, or after it's already burned down, and expect to get coverage for that.
`[28:31]` You also need to know the loss history.
`[28:37]` So you need to know the frequency and the types of losses, because this can be used to predict future losses, and it has a big effect on the terms that the insurance companies will offer, the conditions, as well as the eligibility for insurance.
`[28:45]` But just know what that losses don't equal claims. You can have a loss, but not claim it. So when they look at the loss history, they're not asking about the claims history. You're asking about losses.
`[29:00]` Also, when it comes to the look-back period, it varies.
`[29:04]` So sometimes they can ask for losses in the next three to five years, which is a pretty common look-back period for home or commercial insurance, but when it comes to auto insurance, they can ask typically for five to 10 years of history.
`[29:15]` They might also ask about your insurance history, which is who is your previous insurer? What was the policy number and what was the expiry date?
`[29:25]` This is used to confirm your loss history, check for any unexplained gaps in coverage, or any previous declines or refusals to insure or refusals to renew.
`[29:30]` Was there a good reason for that if another company didn't want it? Maybe this new insurance company doesn't want it either.
`[29:35]` Another thing you can look at is the intermediaries reports, the brokers report.
`[29:45]` Because as the broker, you know the client better than the underwriter at the insurance company does. So you can add some information on their based on your own personal knowledge.
`[29:53]` For example, do you have a relationship with the client? Have you been to their site? Have you visited the property?
`[29:58]` This is very important for getting business approved that would otherwise not be.
`[30:02]` So if something is kind of on the edge of what the insurance company wants to take on, if you have photos or other supporting information to show that the facility's clean is well maintained.
`[30:08]` This might tip the scale and allow the insurance company to either give you a better rate or accept the risk when the otherwise would have declined it.
`[30:18]` Brokers can also do a risk or loss exposure assessment.
`[30:23]` Brokers will typically visit the property to assess the risk, especially if it's a complex risk like a manufacturing risk for example, to ensure that all insurance requirements are met.
`[30:27]` For example, if they're required to have sprinklers, alarm systems, things of that nature, the broker can go on site to make sure those risk management things have been implemented.
`[30:37]` Next up is signatures. So signatures are something great to have because it essentially indicates that the client has reviewed the information and they've agreed that it's accurate and correct.
`[30:51]` When it comes to auto insurance policies, those are always side. Home insurance applications are sometimes signed and commercial applications are rarely signed.
`[31:01]` So it can be or cannot be. It depends on the insurance company whether they require a signature on these applications or not.
`[31:06]` You can also do what's called an audio signature with their client reads it out and agrees on a recorded call.
`[31:18]` Even if signatures on applications are not mandatory, you should always still try to get a signature because while it may not be part of the policy, the policy is still based on the application and you want the client to confirm that the information on the application is correct.
`[31:29]` So the applicant confirms that the statements are true and that they become legally responsible for the answers.
`[31:34]` You never ever want to get a client to sign a blank application form even if they are impatient.
`[31:40]` This is unethical and can lead to potential E&O claims if the information you've later put on there is not correct.
`[31:51]` When it comes to selling a shirt online, which is becoming more and more of a thing, usually it doesn't require signatures, but you could have privacy issues if they're not expressly consenting to the insurer to investigate their information.
`[32:01]` For example, if they fill in some stuff and the insurance company runs a credit check or checks their driving record, there could be issues if the applicant hasn't signed off because they haven't consented for the information to be used in that way.
`[32:16]` So at least, even if you don't have a digital signature feature, you should have a "I have read and confirmed" checkbox.
`[32:20]` When you sign up for an online service, sometimes you have to check the box that you've read all the terms and conditions and you've agreed to it, right? So similar thing here.
`[32:31]` When it comes to using technology for new business and renewals, this can really help increase efficiency, improve accuracy and enhance the customer experience.
`[32:41]` So a lot of brokerages used what's called a CRM, a client relationship management software.
`[32:47]` This allows for efficient client data management, tracking communications, and also automating reminders for policy renewals.
`[32:53]` There's also online applications and coding tools that you can use. This allows clients to access applications online, compare quotes, and even complete buying the insurance online. (So fully automated sort of e-commerce product).
`[33:10]` You can also have automated workflows to streamline data entry, streamline the issuance of policies, as well as renewal notifications.
`[33:15]` So more and more technologies being integrated into this process for brokers and for customers.
`[33:22]` So once you've gone in the application back from the customer, you've sent it out to various insurance companies, you've gone the quotes back, you've presented the various quotes to the client, and they have chosen to proceed with one of the options that you've presented.
`[33:36]` The next step is to take payment, provide the mirror seat, and provide them with all documentation.
`[33:41]` So for example, given a reminder, a confirmation letter, a liability card (in the case auto insurance), those types of documentations that they can prove that they have coverage in place before they leave the building.
`[33:54]` When it comes to taking payments for insurance premiums, it can be in the form of cash, check, debit or credit card, or you can do it through a third party premium financing company if they want to pay monthly, or even some insurers will also offer their own premium financing in-house.
`[34:10]` And of course, payments can be financed or it can be paid in full. It might take some time for the insurance companies to issue the official policy documents.
`[34:15]` So if that's the case, you can send those later, but you want to make sure at least they leave with a binder.
`[34:21]` Otherwise, there are some insurers that will issue the policy documents automatically through some kind of portal or digital platform, and if that's the case, you can send it to them right away on the spot.
`[34:33]` So now let's talk about renewals.
`[34:33]` Renewals are super important for growth and for the profitability of the brokerage, because it's always cheaper to renew business and to keep a client than it is to go and find new business.
`[34:44]` So policies are considered renewed when their expiration dates are extended.
`[34:50]` Most personal lines policies are automatically renewed by the insurers, but you should still review the policies prior to the renewal date and reach out to your client.
`[35:00]` So once a policy reaches, it's expiry date and it hasn't been renewed or extended, it's considered lapsed.
`[35:05]` Renewals don't have the full policy wording attached unless the policy has been modified.
`[35:09]` So if it's the same terms as before, they'll usually just give you a one-page renewal quote sheet without the accompanying policy wording.
`[35:14]` Of course, you can always ask the underwriter to send you those, but if it's the same as the last year, it's really not necessary.
`[35:22]` For renewals, underwriters must ask for updated information on the risk in order to check for eligibility.
`[35:29]` There's an important principle here called the Pareto Principle or the 80-20 rule.
`[35:33]` So in general, 80% of your income is going to come from 20% of clients.
`[35:38]` Either through referrals, being responsive to marketing efforts, or purchasing products or services for the long term. Basically, 80% of your income is going to come from 20% of your clients.
`[35:54]` So now let's talk about step one of the renewal process.
`[35:58]` Typically, you would get what's called an expiration list, which lists out all of the policies that are renewing in the next two to three months.
`[36:04]` You want to reach out and contact the insurers at least two to three months before the renewal date.
`[36:09]` When you reach out to them, you want to check for any changes in the required coverages or limits before policy issuance to save time.
`[36:19]` When you reaching out to your clients, you might be requesting, for example, additional information or updated information for the renewal, so you might send them a questionnaire or, in the case of auto insurance, you might want to send letters to them, recommending of coverage changes or increased limits.
`[36:31]` So you want to use that opportunity to cross-sell and upsell as well as get updated information so you can quote the renewal.
`[36:40]` Step two is upon renewal, notify the insurer.
`[36:45]` So once the client has okay the renewal, let the insurance company know that they're okay to renew.
`[36:50]` You may need to issue a binder and an invoice if the policy doesn't arrive by renewal time.
`[36:55]` And remember that when you do receive the formal policy, you want the double check it for errors first before you set it to the customer.
`[37:01]` So the binder serves as a temporary insurance policy. It's temporary evidence of insurance, pending the issuance of the actual policy.
`[37:07]` And step three is to update the expiration list after the policy delivery so you can have accurate information and get your reminders on time for the next year.
`[37:22]` So now let's talk about some general document processing procedures.
`[37:28]` These are not in any particular order, but it outlines some different documentation processes that we would undertake and what's involved in each of them.
`[37:33]` So the first is collection and submission. Meaning we need to collect all the necessary documents to quote the insurance policy and submit them to the insurance company prompt.
`[37:44]` This involves collecting all the necessary documents and submitting them to the insurance company promptly. This could include things like application forms or any warranties that the insurance company wants signed.
`[37:55]` Next is verification and validation. So we want to check the accuracy of the client information and ensure compliance with all the regulations and policies.
`[38:11]` Another very important piece of the general process is client communication. So we want to keep clients informed of their progress and status of their documents.
`[38:18]` So whether it's applications, endorsements, claims forms and we want to make sure we document all client communications in the client file.
`[38:24]` So the client profile and the notes should include all of the following details in case of any E&O claims:
- Outline the form of communication (call, mail, email, fax).
- If it's some kind of written communication, you want to log a copy onto the system.
- Any policy changes requested or advice offered as well as any acceptance or rejection of any advice by the client.
- The insurers contact information in case they need to file a claim as well as the name of the person you communicated with.
- Confirmation that you've disclosed all of the coverages and its limitations, including coverage recommendations that the customer has rejected.
`[39:08]` When you present the policy or the quotes to the client, you want to make sure that you're presenting them in a clear and detailed manner that reflects the client's needs.
`[39:18]` Coverages and limitations should align with those needs and you can deliver this in person electronically over a Zoom meeting, those all kinds of different ways you can do it, just make sure you keep a record of it who you talk to and what was discussed.
`[39:31]` When it comes to storage and management of documentation, we need to maintain organized files and use the brokerage management system to store and manage client information in a secure way.
`[39:43]` Next is compliance and audits. Conduct regular client file audits and provide ongoing staff training on accurate documentation and compliance.
`[39:55]` So every once in a while, the manager might come in and check your files to make sure that everything required is in there.
`[40:00]` So if you need to upload any client emails and any client communications, call notes that those are all in the file.
`[40:06]` And lastly, retention and disposal. So you need to follow a retention policy and dispose of any unneeded documents.
`[40:20]` When it comes to working in insurance, clear and accurate documentation is super important.
`[40:26]` We need to make sure we comply with all legal and regulatory requirements. So we need to ensure that everything we do in terms of documentation is in compliance with insurance industry regulations and legal requirements and provide a clear audit trail.
`[40:39]` It's also super important for client trust and satisfaction. This boosters transparency and builds trust and also accurate records help us provide better service and more efficient service to the customers.
`[40:51]` And thirdly risk management. Good documentation is a very easy way to reduce E&O risk and helps with dispute resolution.
`[40:57]` So having a standardized workflow with some procedures for how we handle transactions and also sending out letters of confirmation whenever we do anything on the phone will help with that documentation process and lower the risk of us being sued for a mistake.
`[41:15]` Also operational efficiencies and other key benefit of clear and accurate documentation because it will streamline processes and allow us to handle things a lot quicker with some better time management.
`[41:26]` Another key benefit is financial accuracy. This will allow accurate billing and commissions tracking.
`[41:31]` And finally data security and privacy. Handling sensitive data in a secure way will protect against things like data breaches and cyber threats. So using very secure data management systems is very important for that.
`[41:51]` So as brokers you can sort of expect to handle a variety of tasks on any given day of varying urgency.
`[41:57]` There's no hard and fast rule around how you prioritize tasks but there's a couple things that you should base your decision making on.
`[42:04]` So the first are any regulatory or legal obligations. So certain tasks like remaining premiums, disclosure material facts or changes or submitting proof of insurance are not negotiable because they're legal or regulatory requirements.
`[42:14]` So any failure to comply with these could lead to E&O or regulatory issues.
`[42:24]` Or you could become a cross time sensitive client-centered for example renewing their policies before expiry, responding to claims, placing coverage, etc.
`[42:31]` These time sensitive tasks should come first. For example if a client needs insurance on a home and it's closing tomorrow you should probably get on that immediately.
`[42:41]` And then there's other client-centered tasks like renewals. Usually you want to start that two to three months out.
`[42:47]` Could be endorsements could be new business. This may not be as high priority as those time sensitive tasks or those regulatory or legal obligations.
`[43:00]` And finally there are also admin tasks such as updating the CRM updating your brokerage management system, meetings with the team, following up on leads. Those things may not be as important.
`[43:10]` So typically the time-sensitive legal or high-risk tasks should come first before you move on to more routine or administrative tasks.
`[43:24]` So as far as helping you manage this there's a lot of different tools that are available for you.
`[43:30]` You have project management software like Asana or Trello, time management software like Todoist or Microsoft To Do.
`[43:35]` You have calendar and scheduling tools right Google Calendar, Calendly.
`[43:41]` This automated workflow tools you might use like Zapier, Task Management apps like ClickUp or Notion.
`[43:47]` But primarily what you're going to use is what's called your BMS - your brokerage management system. It's kind of like the CRM of your brokerage like Acturist or Epic.
`[34:02]` Those will have task management, abeyance and reminder features that you can use to keep yourself on track and help you manage priorities.
`[44:03]` So outside of processing new business or renewals, we also might be asked from time to time to assist customers with policy changes or remarketing.
`[44:09]` So a policy change involves adding or removing coverage, adjusting limits or changing the named insured.
`[44:19]` You can use things like endorsements, riders to make amendments to the policy.
`[44:24]` When it comes to auto insurance, they're called OPCFs and we'll learn more about that in the auto insurance section.
`[44:33]` Another key activity you might be doing as an insurance broker is called remarketing.
`[44:39]` Remarketing basically means shopping the policy with other insureds. This can happen for a few reasons.
- Maybe an insurance company declines a renewal because they have some change in the risk profile, there's a non-payment of premiums or some issue like that.
- It could also happen when a client requests it. Maybe they want you to find better coverage or lower premiums.
- Or it can also be done upon suggestion of the broker for the same reasons. You say, "Hey, you know what? We haven't shopped it around in a while. Let's shop it to see if we can find you some better pricing."
`[45:01]` So there's a lot of reasons why remarketing might take place.
`[45:07]` Within the life cycle of an insurance policy, there's a couple things that happen:
1. Application process.
2. Underwriting process.
3. Policy issuance (if accepted).
4. Policy changes (throughout the term).
5. Claim process (if they have a claim).
6. Ongoing customer support.
`[45:34]` So let's talk about the application process. When it comes to working with more traditional or mainstream insurers, a lot of them will require detailed paper applications and in-person meetings.
`[45:45]` Nowadays, it might happen over email, but typically it involves filling out an application form, maybe in PDF format, sending it to the insurance company underwriter, and then they might call you or want to discuss the file.
`[46:02]` Nowadays, a lot of underwriters or insurers are going through more of a digital process.
`[46:13]` So some of them will offer online applications through their portals or through some self-serve e-commerce platforms that provide instant quotes and approvals.
`[46:21]` So oftentimes, you can log into an insurance company's portal, type in the information, and they would give you a quote instantly.
`[46:31]` And then if you like it, you can go and bind it or make it effective directly on the platform without ever having to speak with anybody. So this is a very efficient process.
`[46:42]` And there's also broker assisted applications. When brokers can assist clients in completing applications and then submitting to the insurance companies.
`[46:55]` So if you're working with somebody who maybe English isn't their first language or is a more complicated commercial risk, you might want to sit down with a client and then help them fill out the application forms.
`[47:04]` Whether they're online on paper, in a PDF format, whatever the case might be, you could help your clients with that if need be.
`[47:12]` So once you have that application done, it gets sent on to the insurance company. Then they do what's called an underwriting process.
`[47:18]` There's a couple ways they can do it:
- Manual underwriting: An underwriter conducts a detailed manual review. Often used for complex or larger risks.
- Automated underwriting: Using algorithms to assess the risk and quickly determine premiums.
- Hybrid underwriting (most common): Combines automated systems with manual review.
`[48:42]` So once the underwriter has quoted it or declined it and you present the quotes that are available to the client, the client picks one and they seek binding.
`[48:54]` We move on to policy issuance. Sometimes policies can be issued immediately upon approval (more common with digitally advanced companies).
`[48:55]` Otherwise, depending on the company, it can be a deferred issuance where policies are issued after a certain review period.
`[49:07]` So once the policy has been issued, it's been sent to the client, they have their insurance policy, they go about their day. From time to time, they might come back and request some policy changes.
`[49:17]` This can happen in a couple different ways:
- Self-service online.
- Broker assisted.
- Direct insurer changes.
`[49:42]` So they've had their policy from time to time, they are going to have claims.
`[49:50]` Claims processes can be handled in a couple different ways:
- Traditional: Submit a form (paper/online) and wait for manual processing.
- Digital: File and track claims online with digital documentation.
- Broker assisted (VIP clients): Brokers help file claims and liaise with the insurer.
`[50:17]` Customer support can also happen through live chat or email, especially if the broker or provider is more digitally minded.
`[50:31]` And lastly, customers can also get customer support via their broker. Brokers are there to offer personalized service and offer ongoing support to their clients.
`[50:42]` Large brokerages might have call centers, digitally minded brokerages might have live chat or email systems, there's all kinds of different ways that customers can interact with their insurance company via their broker.
`[50:56]` So when it comes to eligibility, availability and pricing of insurance products, there are a lot of factors that play into it.
- Inflation: Rising costs and materials and repairs leading to higher payouts for claims.
- Building values / construction quality.
- Location (risk of flood, wildfire, etc.).
- Age and condition of the building.
- Renovations and upgrades.
- Climate change (frequent/severe weather events).
`[51:44]` Global events also play a big role. Any natural disasters and other large-scale events can significantly impact entire regions.
`[52:01]` New technologies also play a big role (self-driving cars, smart home security). These can influence risk profiles and lead to lower premiums for those that adopt them.
`[52:19]` Conversely, new technologies can also create new risks like cyber attacks.
`[52:19]` And finally, fraud. Insurance claims fraud is a big deal and leads to higher claims costs.
`[52:31]` In addition to these factors, capital also affects the cost of premiums.
- Soft market: Surplus of capital, increased capacity, high competition, reduced premiums, wider scope of risks accepted.
- Hard market: Restricted capital, decreased capacity, less competition, higher premiums, more restrictions on risks.
`[56:06]` So now let's take a detour and talk about organizational structures.
`[56:13]` Establishing an organizational structure involves:
1. Task analysis (list tasks/services).
2. Task grouping (logical grouping for efficiency).
3. Delegate authority (assign tasks to people/teams).
4. Coordinate job positions (proper workflow/communication).
`[58:04]` Organizing a brokerage:
- By line of business (Personal, Commercial, Aviation, Marine). Easy to add new departments as you grow, but can duplicate functions.
- By function (Sales, Marketing, Underwriting, Claims, Accounting, Admin). More specialized skills, but departments might process things differently.
`[59:40]` Structure of insurance companies (usually five departments):
1. Admin (HR, Legal, Materials Management, MIS/IT).
2. Finance (Broker statements, A/P, A/R, Payroll, Investments, Financial Reports).
3. Underwriting (Statistics, Pricing, Risk Selection, Binding Authority, Issuing Policies).
4. Claims (Investigating, Paying Claims, Coordinating Repairs).
5. Marketing (Growth, Profitability, Product Development, Distribution/Promotion).
