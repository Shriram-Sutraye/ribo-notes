## 🔓 Crime Insurance Overview (31:29 - 33:43)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1889.82s-1901.34s):** "Now let's talk about crime insurance. You generally have three types of crime insurance. You have burglary, robbery, and theft. If you remember the commercial property brought form only has coverage for riot and vandalism, that's why you need to buy separate crime insurance policies."

| Why Crime Insurance? |
|---------------------|
| Commercial broad form only covers riot/vandalism |
| Burglary, robbery, theft = separate policies |
| Must purchase specifically |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your regular business insurance covers vandalism (graffiti) but NOT theft. If someone steals from your store, you need SEPARATE crime insurance!

---

### Three Types of Crime Insurance

| Type | Definition | Key Feature |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **Burglary** | Theft with visible signs of force | Nobody saw it happen |
| **Robbery** | Theft with violence/threat | Someone was there |
| **Theft** | Taking without consent | Broadest—any unauthorized taking |

> [!TIP]
> **Memory Trick:**
> - **B**urglary = **B**reak-in (visible marks, nobody there)
> - **R**obbery = **R**ough (violence, person involved)
> - **T**heft = **T**ake (any unauthorized taking)

---

## 🔓 1. Burglary Insurance (31:47 - 32:22)

### A. Mercantile Stock Burglary

> 💡 **From Transcript (1907.26s-1918.38s):** "So the first one is burglary and there's two kinds of burglary insurance. You have mercantile burglary and safe burglary. So mercantile stock burglary covers theft from enclosed premises. If visible signs of force was used to enter and to steal. This includes damaged other property during the burglary."

| Mercantile Stock Burglary |
|--------------------------|
| Theft from enclosed premises |
| Visible signs of force to enter AND steal |
| Includes damage during burglary |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Thief breaks a window (visible force), enters your closed store (enclosed premises), steals products, and damages a display case on the way out. ALL of that is covered—the stolen goods AND the broken window AND the display case.

---

### B. Safe Burglary

> 💡 **From Transcript (1919.18s-1937.02s):** "The safe burglary coverage covers theft of valuable property from a safe if force was used to enter the safe or to remove it from the premises. Also included is coverage for incidental damage. So if they're dragging the safe down the stairs and they damage the stairs, the stairs would be covered."

| Safe Burglary |
|--------------|
| Theft from a safe |
| Force used to enter safe OR remove safe |
| Includes incidental damage |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Dragging Safe

| Scenario |
|----------|
| Thieves drag safe down stairs |
| Stairs get damaged |
| **Stairs are covered** (incidental damage) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Thieves can't open your safe, so they rip it out of the wall and drag it down the stairs. They damage the stairs, the wall, and the floor. Insurance covers the safe contents AND all that damage!

---

## 🔓 2. Robbery Insurance (32:22 - 32:51)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1942.62s-1964.94s):** "Next you have robbery insurance. Robbery insurance covers the robbery of money, securities or valuable property when it's been taken by actual or threatened force to a custodian. A custodian meeting someone who is allowed to have custody of the property, a custodian witness property being taken or the property was taken from the custodian that was killed or rendered unconscious."

| Robbery Insurance |
|------------------|
| Covers money, securities, valuable property |
| Taken by force/threat to a **custodian** |
| Custodian = person allowed to have custody |
| Custodian witnessed taking |
| OR custodian killed/rendered unconscious |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Robbery vs Burglary

> 💡 **From Transcript (1964.94s-1977.34s):** "They suitably with the burglary coverage, it requires signs of force and nobody saw. Think about cap robbery. In and out, nobody saw. Robbery involves a person, either you took it from a person or someone saw you take something."

| Burglary | Robbery |
|----------|---------|
| Signs of force | Violence or threat |
| Nobody saw | Someone was there |
| In and out, quiet | Confrontation |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> - **Burglary**: Store is closed, thief breaks window at 3am, nobody sees anything, they're in and out.
> - **Robbery**: Store is open, thief points gun at cashier, takes money, everyone sees.
> 
> Key difference: Was someone THERE being threatened?

---

## 🔓 3. Theft Insurance - The Broadest (32:51 - 33:43)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1977.34s-1993.82s):** "And finally we have theft. The theft means taking without the owners consent. So as you might have noticed, it's the broadest definition. It doesn't have those restrictions that burglary and robbery insurance had. So the broad form will actually cover you for theft of stock and equipment."

| Theft Insurance |
|----------------|
| Taking without owner's consent |
| BROADEST definition |
| No force requirement |
| No witness requirement |
| Covers theft of stock & equipment |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Theft = anything goes missing that shouldn't. No need to prove break-in marks. No need for someone to be threatened. If it's gone without permission, it's theft.

---

### Money & Securities Coverage

> 💡 **From Transcript (1993.82s-2015.34s):** "However, theft of money and securities must be added. So the money and securities policy will cover actual destruction caused by fire. For example, disappearance, meaning disappearance not attributable to theft. It's gone, you have no idea why. And finally, wrongful abstraction. Wrongful abstraction means any unlawful taking of money and securities."

| Money & Securities Coverage |
|----------------------------|
| Must be ADDED to theft policy |
| Covers: Destruction by fire |
| Covers: Disappearance (not theft—just gone) |
| Covers: Wrongful abstraction (unlawful taking) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Cash register is empty but no one stole it—it just... disappeared? Money & securities covers that. Fire burns your cash? Covered. Employee embezzles? Covered under "wrongful abstraction."

---

## 📉 Business Interruption Insurance (33:43 - 38:03)

> 💡 **From Transcript (2023.34s-2053.659s):** "Another common and very important type of commercial property insurance is business interruption insurance. This restores lost income to your business if it's damaged by an insured peril and you're not able to operate or earn as much as you would have had that insured peril not occur. So because business interruption policies are typically attached to a property insurance policy, the insured perils on the property insurance policy are the same as on the business interruption policy."

| Business Interruption Insurance |
|--------------------------------|
| Restores lost income |
| If damaged by insured peril |
| Same perils as property policy |
| Attached to property policy (endorsement) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Fire destroys your restaurant. You can't cook, you can't earn money. Business Interruption pays you what you WOULD have earned if the fire never happened. It covers your lost profits while you rebuild.

---

### Coverage Period

> 💡 **From Transcript (2054.94s-2076.699s):** "Covered for business interruption typically starts from the date of loss up to 12 months. So that means it can pay you even past the policy period. For example, if your policy comes up in one month and you have a loss, it will cover you for 12 months even after your policy expired. So even if you choose not to renew, you will still have that business interruption coverage from that insurance company."

| Coverage Period |
|----------------|
| Date of loss → up to 12 months |
| Pays even PAST policy expiry |
| Even if you don't renew, still covered |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your policy expires next month, but fire happens today. BI will pay you for 12 months—even after your policy ends! You're covered for the full year after the loss.

---

### What It Pays

> 💡 **From Transcript (2076.699s-2092.46s):** "It pays for loss net profits plus expenses that continue during the business interruption. So for example, even if your business is not operating, you might still be responsible for paying certain salaries, taxes, mortgage payment, rent, things like that."

| What BI Pays |
|-------------|
| Lost net profits |
| Continuing expenses: |
| - Salaries |
| - Taxes |
| - Mortgage payments |
| - Rent |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Factory burns down. You're making $0. But you still owe:
> - Rent to the landlord
> - Salaries to key employees you want to keep
> - Your business mortgage
> BI pays all of that PLUS the profits you're missing.

---

### Extra Expenses to Reduce Loss

> 💡 **From Transcript (2093.5s-2115.82s):** "In addition, it will also cover any expenses that are necessary if you can prove that it will reduce the amount of loss. So say for example, if you can open up a trailer outside of a your restaurant and still serve food and earn some income that reduces the amount of loss revenue, the insurance company will pay for that."

### 📋 Transcript Example: Restaurant Trailer

| Scenario |
|----------|
| Restaurant burns down |
| You set up a food trailer outside |
| You earn SOME income (reduces loss) |
| **Insurance pays for the trailer setup** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your pizzeria burns. You rent a food truck and keep selling pizza. The food truck costs $5K/month. Insurance pays for the truck because it REDUCES how much they owe you in lost profits!

---

## 📊 Three Types of BI Insurance (34:55 - 37:40)

> 💡 **From Transcript (2115.82s-2128.7s):** "So there's three different types of business interruptions insurance. The first is the gross earnings form. This will pay you the loss income until your property has been repaired or 12 months whichever comes first."

| Type | Pays Until | Best For |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Gross Earnings** | Property repaired OR 12 months | Most businesses |
| **Profits Form** | Income restored OR 12 months | Long-term customer loss |
| **Extra Expenses** | N/A (costs only) | Quick-resume businesses |

---

### 1. Gross Earnings Form

> 💡 **From Transcript (2121.5s-2128.7s):** "The first is the gross earnings form. This will pay you the loss income until your property has been repaired or 12 months whichever comes first."

| Gross Earnings |
|---------------|
| Pays until property repaired OR 12 months |
| Whichever comes first |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Building fixed in 4 months? BI stops at 4 months. Building takes 14 months to fix? BI stops at 12 months (the max). You get the SHORTER of the two.

---

### 2. Profits Form (More Expensive)

> 💡 **From Transcript (2128.7s-2165.18s):** "The second is the profits form. This one offers a little bit more coverage because it pays you until your income has been restored or 12 months because the amount of time it takes for you to achieve or to recover the same amount of monthly income could be longer than what it would take to simply rebuild your property. For example, if you run a business like a newspaper or a dry cleaners, by being out of business for a couple months, you might actually lose long-term customers."

| Profits Form |
|-------------|
| Pays until income RESTORED OR 12 months |
| More coverage = more expensive |
| For businesses that lose customers |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Newspaper/Dry Cleaner

| Scenario |
|----------|
| Dry cleaner closed for 3 months |
| Customers went to competitors |
| Building fixed, but business slow |
| Profits form keeps paying until revenue is back |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> - **Gross Earnings**: Building fixed = payments stop.
> - **Profits Form**: Even after building is fixed, customers haven't come back yet. Profits Form keeps paying until your actual REVENUE matches what it was before.
> 
> A newspaper loses subscribers while closed. Even after reopening, it takes months to win them back. Profits Form covers that gap!

---

### 3. Extra Expenses Insurance

> 💡 **From Transcript (2180.54s-2228.86s):** "The third type is the extra expenses insurance. This does not pay for lost income per se. What it does is it pays for any extra expenses that you need to maintain your normal course of business. So with this one, you do not need to prove that those expenses will reduce the amount of loss anymore."

| Extra Expenses Insurance |
|-------------------------|
| Does NOT pay lost income |
| Pays extra costs to stay in business |
| No need to prove it reduces loss |
| For businesses that can resume QUICKLY |

---

### 📋 Who Uses Extra Expenses?

> 💡 **From Transcript (2216.22s-2239.02s):** "This is purchased typically by those types of businesses that can resume business quickly after an interruption. So things like insurance brokers, travel agents, doctors, and even banks can recover their business pretty quickly. If you're a lawyer or an insurance broker, all you really need to do business these days is a laptop and maybe a phone."

| Business Type | Why Extra Expenses Works |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| Insurance brokers | Just need laptop + phone |
| Travel agents | Work from anywhere |
| Doctors | Find temporary office quickly |
| Banks | Must stay operational |
| Lawyers | Work remotely |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> A lawyer's office burns down. They rent another office, buy a new laptop, and they're back in business the next week. They didn't really LOSE income—they just had EXTRA COSTS. Extra Expenses covers those costs.

---

### Examples of Covered Expenses

> 💡 **From Transcript (2245.82s-2260.86s):** "Some examples of things that would cover could be renting a temporary premises, renting some temporary equipment so you can continue to operate or even paying overtime salaries for people to try to recover your business and rebuild this quickly as possible."

| Extra Expenses Covers |
|----------------------|
| Renting temporary premises |
| Renting temporary equipment |
| Overtime salaries to rebuild faster |

---

### BI Is An Endorsement (Same Perils)

> 💡 **From Transcript (2260.86s-2283.74s):** "So it can be purchased on a standalone basis for the types of businesses that don't really need full business interruption, but it can also be added on to a gross earnings form or a profits form. It's key to note that this is interruption is not a standalone policy. It's added via endorsement to your regular commercial property insurance because the triggers or the perils that trigger it are the same."

| Key Points |
|-----------|
| BI is NOT standalone |
| Added via endorsement to property policy |
| Same perils as property policy |
| If property excludes earthquake → BI excludes earthquake |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Business Interruption is like an "add-on" to your property insurance. Whatever your property policy covers, BI covers. Whatever it excludes, BI excludes too. Property doesn't cover floods? Neither does your BI.
