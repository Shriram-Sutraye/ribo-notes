# ⚖️ Basics of Legal Liability - Part 2
# Contract Law & Tort Law: The Two Branches of Civil Law

> **Timestamp:** 2:11 - 4:00 (131s - 240s) | **Chapter 08 - Part 2**

---

## 🌳 Two Branches of Civil Law (2:11 - 2:25)

> 💡 **From Transcript (131.76s-137.92s):** "Now within civil law, there are two branches. You have contract law, which governs contracts, and tort law, which governs torts."

| Two Branches of Civil Law |
|--------------------------|
| **1. Contract Law** - governs contracts |
| **2. Tort Law** - governs torts |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Civil law splits into two parts:
> 1. **Contract Law:** When you have an AGREEMENT with someone and they break it
> 2. **Tort Law:** When someone harms you but you have NO contract with them
> 
> Contract = agreement broken | Tort = just got harmed

---

## 📋 Contract Law (2:25 - 2:39)

> 💡 **From Transcript (137.92s-145.68s):** "So contract laws are meant to enforce contracts."

> 💡 **From Transcript (145.68s-150.72s):** "Remedies for breach of contract are done by enforcing performance."

| Contract Law |
|-------------|
| Meant to **ENFORCE contracts** |
| Remedy = Enforcing performance |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Contract law is simple: You made a deal, they didn't keep their end of it. The court makes them either:
> 1. DO what they promised, or
> 2. PAY YOU for not doing it
> 
> It's about holding people to their word!

### 📋 Transcript Example: Fence Contract

> 💡 **From Transcript (150.72s-155.44s):** "For example, if I contract with you to build you a fence, you pay me the money. I don't build you a fence."

> 💡 **From Transcript (155.44s-159.28s):** "you can go to court and sue me to either get me to return the money or to actually build the fence."

| Fence Contract Example |
|-----------------------|
| **Scenario:** You hire me to build a fence |
| **What happened:** You paid me, I didn't build it |
| **Your options in court:** |
| 1. Force me to RETURN THE MONEY, or |
| 2. Force me to BUILD THE FENCE |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You paid the contractor $5,000 to build your fence. He took the money and disappeared. You sue him. The court says: "Either give back the $5,000 OR finish building that fence!" That's contract law—making people keep their promises.

---

## ⚠️ Tort Law: Definition (2:39 - 2:57)

> 💡 **From Transcript (159.76s-166.48s):** "Next we have tort law. So tort is defined as a private wrong other than read your contract that causes damage to somebody, whether that's financial or otherwise."

| Tort Definition |
|----------------|
| A **private wrong** |
| **OTHER THAN** breach of contract |
| Causes **damage** (financial or otherwise) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> A "tort" is fancy legal language for: "You harmed me, but we didn't have a contract." It's a WRONG that isn't a crime and isn't a broken contract. Examples:
> - Someone runs over your mailbox (no contract, not a crime—it's a tort!)
> - A store's slippery floor makes you fall (no contract with the store about floor safety)

---

### Examples of Torts

> 💡 **From Transcript (166.48s-171.68s):** "Examples of torts include negligence, trespass, nuisance, defamation, false arrest, or invasion of privacy."

| Examples of Torts |
|------------------|
| **Negligence** - carelessness causing harm |
| **Trespass** - entering property without permission |
| **Nuisance** - unreasonably interfering with property use |
| **Defamation** - damaging someone's reputation |
| **False arrest** - wrongfully detaining someone |
| **Invasion of privacy** - violating privacy rights |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> These are all ways someone can WRONG you without breaking a contract:
> - **Negligence:** "They were careless and I got hurt"
> - **Trespass:** "They walked on my property without asking"
> - **Nuisance:** "My neighbor's loud parties ruin my sleep"
> - **Defamation:** "They spread lies about me and ruined my reputation"
> - **False arrest:** "Security guard detained me for no reason"
> - **Invasion of privacy:** "They published my private photos"

## 📋 Three Elements to Prove a Tort (2:58 - 3:38)

> 💡 **From Transcript (178.48s-183.2s):** "When it comes to suing somebody in tort law and to actually prove a tort had occurred, there are three elements you need to prove."

| To Prove a Tort |
|----------------|
| You must prove **THREE elements** |
| Missing ANY element = case fails |

---

### Element 1: Legal Duty Owed

> 💡 **From Transcript (183.2s-189.2s):** "The first is you need to prove that that person owed you a legal duty."

> 💡 **From Transcript (189.28s-195.04s):** "meaning you had a right not to be harmed and a duty not to cause harm to that person."

| Element 1: Legal Duty |
|----------------------|
| That person **OWED YOU a legal duty** |
| You had a right NOT to be harmed |
| They had a duty NOT to harm you |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> First, prove that the person had a RESPONSIBILITY toward you. For example:
> - A driver has a duty to drive safely around pedestrians
> - A store has a duty to keep floors safe for customers
> - A doctor has a duty to treat patients properly
> 
> If they had NO duty toward you, they can't be liable!

---

### Element 2: Legal Duty Was Breached

> 💡 **From Transcript (195.04s-201.2s):** "The second element is that that legal duty was breached."

| Element 2: Breach |
|------------------|
| The legal duty was **BREACHED** |
| They failed to fulfill their duty |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Second, prove they BROKE that duty. The driver was texting while driving. The store didn't put up a wet floor sign. The doctor prescribed the wrong medicine. They had a duty and they FAILED it.

---

### Element 3: Damages Resulted

> 💡 **From Transcript (201.2s-207.04s):** "and the third element is that damages directly resulted from that breach of legal duty."

> 💡 **From Transcript (207.04s-212.64s):** "So that means the damage must be a proximate result of the breach, meaning that there is an uninterrupted chain of events."

> 💡 **From Transcript (212.72s-218.64s):** "leading to the damage. You must prove all three of these elements for a torts to be proven."

| Element 3: Damages |
|-------------------|
| Damages **DIRECTLY resulted** from the breach |
| Must be a **PROXIMATE result** |
| **Uninterrupted chain of events** |
| Breach → Chain of events → Damage |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Third, prove you were actually HURT by their breach. And the hurt has to be BECAUSE of their breach—not some random coincidence.
> 
> **Good chain:** Driver texting → hit you → you broke your leg
> **Broken chain:** Driver texting → near miss → you got scared → went home → fell down your own stairs
> 
> The second one doesn't count because there's a BREAK in the chain!

---

### 🔗 Proximate Cause (Chain of Events)

| What is Proximate Cause? |
|-------------------------|
| The damage DIRECTLY flows from the breach |
| No interruptions in the chain |
| The breach was the actual cause |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> "Proximate" means CLOSE or DIRECT. There has to be a clear, unbroken line from what they did wrong → to your injury. If something else happened in between that broke the connection, you can't blame them for your injury.

---

## 🔗 Concurrent Causation (3:39 - 4:00)

> 💡 **From Transcript (219.92s-224.799s):** "Torts may also involve something called concurrent causation, where two different parties cause two independent events that combine together to produce one loss."

| Concurrent Causation |
|---------------------|
| TWO different parties |
| TWO independent events |
| COMBINE to produce ONE loss |
| Both can be liable! |

---

### 📋 Transcript Example: Pedestrian Hit by Car

> 💡 **From Transcript (224.799s-231.04s):** "For example, if a pedestrian is hit by a car at night, the driver may be liable for speeding."

> 💡 **From Transcript (231.04s-235.92s):** "but the city may also be liable for failing to maintain a street light, making it too dark for the driver to see the pedestrian."

| Pedestrian Example |
|-------------------|
| **Party 1:** Driver was speeding |
| **Party 2:** City didn't maintain streetlight |
| **Combined result:** Pedestrian was hit |
| **Both are liable!** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> A pedestrian gets hit by a car at night. Who's at fault?
> - **Driver:** Was speeding (his fault!)
> - **City:** Street light was broken, too dark to see (city's fault too!)
> 
> Both the driver AND the city can be held responsible because BOTH contributed to the accident. This is "concurrent causation"—two wrongs combined into one disaster.
