## 📚 Key Definitions to Know

Before diving in, memorize these terms:

| Term | Simple Meaning |
|------|----------------|
| **"Insured"** | The person covered + their employees |
| **AoI** | Amount of Insurance (how much coverage you have) |
| **"On Premises"** | At the address listed on the policy |
| **"Controlled"** | Owned, rented, or controlled by the insured |
| **"Owned"** | Owned, rented, OR leased (all count as "owned") |
| **"Vehicles"** | Includes cars, watercraft, AND motorized vehicles |

> 💡 **Exam Tip:** When the policy says "owned," it includes rented and leased too!

---

## 1️⃣ Definition of Insurance

> **Insurance** = An undertaking (agreement) by one party (insurer) to indemnify (compensate) another (insured) if a specific peril (danger/risk) damages an object of insurance (the thing being covered).

### The 5 Key Elements (MEMORIZE THIS):

| # | Element | Simple Explanation | Example |
|---|---------|---------------------|---------|
| 1 | **Transfer Risk** | You pay an insurer to take on your risk | You pay $100/month so if your house burns, THEY pay, not you |
| 2 | **Promise to Pay** | Insurer promises to pay when a **specific peril** (covered danger) damages the **object of insurance** (covered thing) OR when you cause loss to others | Fire damages your house = insurer pays. You hit someone's car = insurer pays them |
| 3 | **Accidental Losses Only** | Only pays for **unexpected** losses that happen **after** the policy starts | ✅ Lightning strike. ❌ You set your own house on fire |
| 4 | **Principle of Indemnity** | Payment = Amount of Loss based on value **immediately before** the loss. No profit! | Your 5-year-old TV was worth $300 before loss = you get $300, not $800 (original price) |
| 5 | **Money or Repair/Replace** | Insurer can pay cash, repair the item, OR replace it | Car accident: insurer can pay you cash OR send it to a shop |

> 💡 **Why Accidental Only?** If insurance paid for intentional losses, people would burn their own stuff for money. That's fraud!

## 2️⃣ Functions of Insurance

Insurance serves **5 major functions** in society:

### Overview:

| Function | What It Means | Why It Matters |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| **Spread Risk** | From few to many | Most important function! |
| **Loss Prevention/Reduction** | Insurers help reduce losses | Saves money for everyone |
| **Peace of Mind** | Eliminates worry | Lets people take risks |
| **Supply Credit** | Lenders require insurance | Can't get a mortgage without it |
| **Source of Jobs & Capital** | Insurers invest premiums | Huge industry, lots of jobs |

---

### 📌 Spread Risk (MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION)

> **Concept:** Premiums from MANY people are pooled together to pay losses of the FEW who actually have claims.

#### How It Works:

| Without Insurance | With Insurance |
|-------------------|----------------|
| You alone pay $500,000 for your house fire | 100,000 people each pay $500/year |
| Financial ruin! | Pool of $50 million pays the few who have fires |

> 💡 **Think of it like:** Everyone chips in $5 to a pizza fund. If you get hungry, the fund buys you pizza. Most people don't get hungry, but those who do are covered.

---

### 📌 Loss Prevention/Reduction

Insurers actively help **prevent and reduce losses**:

| How Insurers Help | Example |
|-------------------|---------|
| Send reps to visit sites | Inspector visits your factory, suggests sprinklers |
| Offer discounts for safety | 10% off for home alarm system |
| Partner with communities | Campaigns against insurance fraud |
| Nationwide safety programs | Fire prevention awareness |

> 💡 **Why do they do this?** Fewer claims = more profit for insurer. It's a win-win!

---

### 📌 Peace of Mind

> **Concept:** You pay a **small fixed amount** (premium) to fend off **large uncertain losses** (claims).

| Without Insurance | With Insurance |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Constant worry: "What if my house burns?" | Relaxed: "I'm covered, no big deal" |
| Can't take risks: "I'm scared to start a business" | Can take risks: "If it fails, I'm protected" |

> 💡 **This enables entrepreneurship!** People are more willing to start businesses, buy property, and invest.

---

### 📌 Supply Credit

> **Concept:** Lenders (banks) won't lend money for **unprotected property** — you must show **evidence of insurance** to close the deal.

| Situation | What Happens |
|-----------|--------------|
| Buying a house with mortgage | Bank requires home insurance BEFORE closing |
| Financing a car | Dealer requires auto insurance BEFORE driving off |
| Business loan for equipment | Bank may require equipment insurance |

> 💡 **Why?** If the house burns down, the bank loses their collateral. Insurance protects THEM too!

---

### 📌 Source of Jobs & Capital

Insurers **invest the premiums** they collect:

| What Insurers Do | Impact |
|------------------|--------|
| Invest in bonds, stocks, real estate | Provides capital for economy |
| Employ thousands of people | Underwriters, adjusters, agents, brokers |
| Ontario P&C alone | 125,000+ jobs |

> 💡 **Premiums don't sit in a vault** — they're invested and working in the economy until needed for claims.

---

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer: b) Paid to policyholders as dividends or kept in reserve**

Mutual companies are owned by **policyholders**. Any surplus is either:
- Paid to policyholders as dividends
- Reinvested in the company
- Kept in reserve for future claims

</details>

---

### Question 2:
> An Assessment Mutual is running low on funds to pay claims. What can they do?
> 
> a) Nothing, they must dip into reserves  
> b) Call the uncalled portion of the premium note from policyholders  
> c) Increase premiums for next year only  
> d) File for bankruptcy

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer: b) Call the uncalled portion of the premium note from policyholders**

Assessment Mutuals have policyholders sign a **premium note** with a maximum payable amount. They pay an **initial premium** upfront. If claims exceed the fund, the mutual can request the **uncalled portion** (the remainder up to the max).

**Key:** This is what makes Assessment Mutuals unique — you may have to pay more!

</details>

---

### Question 3:
> What is the MOST important function of insurance?
> 
> a) Providing peace of mind  
> b) Spreading risk from few to many  
> c) Supplying credit to lenders  
> d) Creating jobs and capital

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer: b) Spreading risk from few to many**

Risk spreading is the **fundamental purpose** of insurance. By pooling premiums from many people, the losses of the few can be paid. Without this function, individual loss would be catastrophic.
