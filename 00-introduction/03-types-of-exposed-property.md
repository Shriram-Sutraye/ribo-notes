## Overview

Not all property is the same! Insurance categorizes property into different types because they require different coverage approaches.

## The 4 Types of Exposed Property

| Type | What It Is | Can You Touch It? |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| **Tangible** | Physical items you can see/touch | ✅ Yes |
| **Intangible** | Non-physical assets with value | ❌ No |
| **Net Income** | The money/profits a business earns | ❌ No |
| **Key Personnel** | Important people in an organization | 👤 People |

---

## 1️⃣ Tangible Property

**Definition:** Physical property that you can see, touch, and measure.

### Categories:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Real Property** | Buildings, land, structures attached to land |
| **Personal Property** | Furniture, equipment, inventory, vehicles |
| **Contents** | Everything inside a building |

### Examples:
| Tangible Asset | Type | Insured Under |
|----------------|------|---------------|
| 🏠 House | Real property | Homeowner's policy |
| 🚗 Car | Personal property | Auto policy |
| 💻 Office computers | Contents | Commercial property |
| 📦 Store inventory | Personal property | Business property |
| 🛠️ Factory machinery | Personal property | Equipment floater |

### Real-Life Scenario:
> **Mike's Auto Shop**
> 
> Mike owns:
> - The building (real property)
> - Hydraulic lifts (equipment/personal property)
> - Tools and parts inventory (contents)
> - 2 company trucks (personal property)
> 
> All of these are **tangible** — you can physically see and touch them.

---

## 2️⃣ Intangible Property

**Definition:** Assets that have value but no physical form — you can't touch them.

### Examples:

| Intangible Asset | Description | How It Can Be Lost |
|------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| 💼 **Goodwill** | Reputation and customer loyalty | Bad publicity, scandal |
| ™️ **Trademarks** | Brand names, logos | Infringement by others |
| 📜 **Patents** | Exclusive rights to inventions | Expiration, theft of IP |
| 📝 **Contracts** | Valuable business agreements | Breach, non-renewal |
| 🗂️ **Data/Records** | Customer info, financial records | Cyber attack, fire |
| 📚 **Copyright** | Rights to creative works | Piracy |

### Real-Life Scenario:
> **Tim Hortons Franchise**
> 
> A franchisee's most valuable **intangible asset** is the **brand name**. Without "Tim Hortons" on the sign, the same coffee shop would make far less money.
> 
> If Tim Hortons' reputation is damaged by a national scandal, even a perfectly-run franchise loses value.

> 💡 **Key Point:** You can't insure "goodwill" with standard property insurance. That's why reputation matters!

---

## 3️⃣ Net Income

**Definition:** The profit or revenue stream that a business generates. If operations stop, net income stops.

### Why It Matters:
> If a fire destroys a restaurant, the **building** is a tangible property loss. But the **lost profits** while closed for repairs? That's a **net income** exposure.

### Components of Net Income Loss:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Lost Revenue** | Sales you would have made |
| **Continuing Expenses** | Rent, salaries, utilities you still pay |
| **Extra Expenses** | Costs to keep operating (temporary location) |

### Example:
> **Sarah's Coffee Shop (Revisited)**
> 
> Fire closes the shop for 6 weeks.
> 
> | Loss Type | Amount |
> |-----------|--------|
> | Normal monthly profit | $15,000 × 1.5 months = $22,500 |
> | Rent still due | $5,000 |
> | Employee wages (to keep them) | $8,000 |
> | **Total Net Income Loss** | **$35,500** |

### Insurance Solution:
- **Business Interruption Insurance** covers net income loss
- Also called "Loss of Business Income" coverage

## 4️⃣ Key Personnel

**Definition:** People who are essential to a business's success. If they're gone, the business suffers.

### Who Qualifies as Key Personnel?

| Role | Why They're Key |
|------|-----------------|
| **Founder/CEO** | Vision, leadership, relationships |
| **Top Salesperson** | Generates majority of revenue |
| **Chief Scientist** | Holds critical knowledge |
| **Key Partner** | Contributes capital or expertise |
| **Specialized Technician** | Only person who can do certain tasks |

### Real-Life Scenario:
> **Small Law Firm**
> 
> The firm has 3 partners:
> - Partner A brings in 80% of clients
> - Partners B and C do the legal work
> 
> If **Partner A dies**, the firm loses most of its new business. Even though no physical property was damaged, the **value of the firm drops significantly**.

### Insurance Solutions:
| Coverage | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Key Person Insurance** | Pays business if key person dies/disabled |
| **Buy-Sell Agreement** | Funded by life insurance to buy out deceased partner's share |
| **Disability Income** | Replaces income if key person is disabled |

| **Net Income** | ❌ No | Profits, revenue stream | Business interruption |
| **Key Personnel** | 👤 People | Owners, key employees | Key person insurance |

## 🧠 Practice Question

> A tech startup's most valuable asset is its proprietary software algorithm (worth $2 million). A fire destroys the office, but the algorithm was backed up to the cloud and is safe.
> 
> **What type of property is the algorithm?**
> 
> a) Tangible Property  
> b) Intangible Property  
> c) Net Income  
> d) Key Personnel

<details>
<summary>Click to reveal answer</summary>

**Answer: b) Intangible Property**

The algorithm is intellectual property — it has significant value but no physical form. You can't touch or hold an algorithm. The computers it runs on are tangible, but the algorithm itself is intangible.
