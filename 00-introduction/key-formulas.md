## Co-Insurance Formula

```
Claim Payment = (Insurance Carried / Insurance Required) × Loss
```

Where:
- **Insurance Required** = Property Value × Co-insurance %

### Example:
- Building Value: $500,000
- Insurance Purchased: $300,000
- Co-insurance Requirement: 80%
- Loss: $50,000

**Step 1:** Required Insurance = $500,000 × 80% = $400,000

**Step 2:** Claim Payment = ($300,000 / $400,000) × $50,000 = $37,500

**Step 3:** Insured Absorbs = $50,000 - $37,500 = **$12,500**
