> **Timestamp:** 15:30 - 19:00 (930s - 1140s) | **Chapter 08 - Part 7**

---

## 🏢 Premises Liability (15:57 - 16:30)

> 💡 **From Transcript (960.0s-966.079s):** "There are also many legal precedence that surround premises liability, which handles any injuries occurring on the occupiers premises."

> 💡 **From Transcript (966.079s-970.64s):** "which is very similar to what we discussed around ownership of property previously."

| Premises Liability |
|-------------------|
| Handles injuries on occupier's premises |
| Similar to ownership liability |
| Based on legal precedence |

---

### Owner's Legal Duty

> 💡 **From Transcript (970.64s-976.319s):** "So an owner has a legal duty to keep the premises reasonably safe for visitors."

> 💡 **From Transcript (976.4s-982.4s):** "Visitors will include inviteees, licensees and trespassers."

| Owner's Duty |
|-------------|
| Keep premises **reasonably safe** |
| For ALL visitors: |
| - Invitees |
| - Licensees |
| - Trespassers |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> If you own property, you must keep it reasonably safe for EVERYONE who might be there—even trespassers to some extent (no traps!). The level of care varies, but you have SOME duty to all.

---

### Premises Liability Claims

> 💡 **From Transcript (983.92s-989.2s):** "Any claims for premises liability here will alleged knowledge of the dangerous condition and then a failure to fix it or to warn visitors of the dangerous condition."

> 💡 **From Transcript (989.2s-993.36s):** "The injured person must prove that there was negligence on the part of the premises occupier."

| Premises Claims Allege: |
|------------------------|
| 1. You KNEW about danger |
| 2. You FAILED to fix OR warn |
| 3. Injured person proves your negligence |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> To win a premises liability claim, the injured person says:
> 1. "You knew there was a broken step" (knowledge)
> 2. "You didn't fix it or warn me" (failure)
> 3. "And that's why I fell and got hurt" (causation)

---

## 📋 The Insuring Agreement (16:38 - 16:55)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1001.92s-1005.76s):** "Now let's talk about the ensuring agreement that governs liability policies."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1006.32s-1011.12s):** "The first piece is that liability policies ensure against bodily injury and property damage."

| Liability Policies Cover |
|-------------------------|
| **Bodily Injury** |
| **Property Damage** |

---

## 🤕 Bodily Injury (16:55 - 17:15)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1012.0s-1015.2s):** "Body injury is defined as either injury, sickness, or death."

| Bodily Injury = |
|----------------|
| **Injury** |
| **Sickness** |
| **Death** |

---

### Injury vs Sickness

> 💡 **From Transcript (1016.16s-1020.72s):** "Body injury is something that comes from external sources. It's usually physical like any hit by a car."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1020.72s-1025.6s):** "Sickness is something that manifests internally, such as developing cancer after consuming poison water."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1025.6s-1030.88s):** "Death means death resulting from either bodily injury or sickness."

| Type | Source | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Injury** | External | Hit by car (physical) |
| **Sickness** | Internal | Cancer from poison water |
| **Death** | From either | Result of injury or sickness |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> - **Injury:** Something from the OUTSIDE hurts you (car crash, fall)
> - **Sickness:** Something goes wrong INSIDE you (poisoning causes cancer)
> - **Death:** The ultimate result of either

---

## 🏠 Property Damage (17:15 - 17:27)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1030.88s-1038.16s):** "Property damage means physical injury to tangible property including the loss of use to undamaged property."

| Property Damage = |
|------------------|
| Physical injury to **tangible property** |
| PLUS: Loss of use of **undamaged property** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Property damage covers:
> - The thing you broke (the crashed car)
> - AND the use they lost (can't use the car while it's being fixed)
> 
> Even if you didn't damage something directly, if they can't USE it because of what you did, that counts!

---

## ⚠️ Key Characteristic: Legal Liability Required (17:27 - 17:42)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1038.16s-1044.16s):** "An important characteristic of liability policies is that they only pay when the insured is found legally liable."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1044.16s-1049.6s):** "That means the insured has to lose in court before the liability policy will pay damages."

| KEY CHARACTERISTIC |
|-------------------|
| Only pay when insured is **legally liable** |
| Must LOSE in court first |
| Then policy pays damages |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Liability insurance only kicks in if you're found AT FAULT. Unlike property insurance where you just report a loss, liability insurance waits until a court says "yes, you owe them money." Then your insurance pays.

---

## 👥 Third Party Payments Only (17:42 - 17:55)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1049.6s-1057.36s):** "Coverage also only available to third parties. That means payments are only available to parties that are not named on the policy."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1057.36s-1063.76s):** "If you are named on the policy, you are not considered a third party and therefore are not entitled to receive payment for damages."

| Third Party Rule |
|-----------------|
| Payments ONLY to third parties |
| Third party = NOT named on policy |
| Named insured CANNOT receive payments |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Liability insurance protects you by paying OTHER PEOPLE you've harmed. You can't pay yourself! If your name is on the policy, you're NOT a third party—you can't collect from your own liability insurance.

---

## 💰 Types of Damages (17:55 - 18:40)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1063.76s-1069.52s):** "Liability policies also only pay for compensatory damages."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1069.52s-1077.52s):** "That means there's no coverage for normative or non-damages and there's no coverage for punitive or exemplary damages."

| Liability Insurance Pays For: |
|-----------------------------|
| ✅ **Compensatory damages** only |
| ❌ Nominal damages |
| ❌ Punitive/exemplary damages |

---

### Nominal Damages

> 💡 **From Transcript (1077.52s-1083.04s):** "Normative or nominal damages are awarded when there is liability but there's no actual damage."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1083.12s-1090.24s):** "In that case, the court would order the defendant to pay the plaintiff $1 or some other nominal sum to determine who was right and who was wrong."

| Nominal Damages |
|----------------|
| Liability exists but NO actual damage |
| Court orders tiny payment ($1) |
| Purpose: Determine right vs wrong |
| **NOT insurable!** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Sometimes you were WRONG but didn't actually HURT anyone. Court says "pay them $1" just to officially say you were wrong. Insurance doesn't cover this—there's no real loss to pay for!

---

### Punitive/Exemplary Damages

> 💡 **From Transcript (1090.24s-1097.36s):** "Exemplary or punitive damages exist to punish the defendant."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1097.36s-1103.76s):** "This could include fines or other aggravated damages."

| Punitive Damages |
|-----------------|
| Purpose: PUNISH the defendant |
| Includes fines, aggravated damages |
| **NOT insurable!** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Punitive damages = "We're punishing you for being really bad!" The court wants to make an example of you. Insurance CAN'T cover this—if it did, there'd be no punishment! You pay this from your own pocket.

---

### Compensatory Damages

> 💡 **From Transcript (1103.76s-1111.44s):** "Compensatory damages are amounts meant to compensate the wrong party for their injuries. This is the only type of damage that is insurable."

| Compensatory Damages |
|--------------------|
| Compensate the victim for injuries |
| **ONLY type that is insurable!** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Compensatory damages = "This is what it actually COSTS to make things right." Medical bills, lost wages, repair costs—the real expenses. THIS is what liability insurance pays!

---

## 📅 Occurrence Basis (18:40 - 19:00)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1111.44s-1116.56s):** "Coverage is also provided on an occurrence basis. That means the policy that was enforced at the time the loss occurred is the one that pays."

| Occurrence Basis |
|-----------------|
| Policy in force when loss OCCURRED |
| = The one that pays |

---

### 📋 Transcript Example: Chemical Leak

> 💡 **From Transcript (1116.56s-1124.24s):** "For example, if there's a chemical leak that started in 2008 but was not discovered or the claim was not brought until 2018."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1124.24s-1129.76s):** "if the 2008 policy that would pay provided that policy was a current based."

| Chemical Leak Example |
|----------------------|
| **Leak started:** 2008 |
| **Discovered/Claimed:** 2018 |
| **Which policy pays:** 2008 policy! |
| (If it was occurrence-based) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> A pipe leaked chemicals in 2008 but nobody noticed until 2018. Which insurance pays? The 2008 insurance! Because that's when the occurrence HAPPENED—even though it was discovered 10 years later.

---

### What is an "Occurrence"?

> 💡 **From Transcript (1135.68s-1149.44s):** "It occurrence is defined as an accident, including long-term exposure."

| Occurrence = |
|-------------|
| An **accident** OR |
| **Long-term exposure** |

---

### Accident vs Long-term Exposure

> 💡 **From Transcript (1149.44s-1155.52s):** "An accident is defined as something that is sudden and unexpected and occurs at a particular point in time such as a car crash."

> 💡 **From Transcript (1155.52s-1161.6s):** "It continues or long-term exposure occurs over a long period of time, such as being exposed to contaminated baby powder for a number of years."

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Accident** | Sudden, unexpected, specific time | Car crash |
| **Long-term Exposure** | Happens over years | Contaminated baby powder |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Two kinds of occurrences:
> - **Accident:** BOOM! Car crash at 3pm on Tuesday (sudden, specific moment)
> - **Long-term exposure:** Using contaminated baby powder for 10 years and developing cancer (gradual, over time)
> 
> Both count as "occurrences" for insurance purposes.
