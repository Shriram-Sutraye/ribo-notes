## 📦 General (P&C) Insurance Categories

**General Insurance** = Property & Casualty Insurance

There are **3 main categories** of general insurance:

### 1️⃣ Automobile Insurance 🚗

- **Largest by volume** - Required by law in Canada
- If you own/drive a car, you **must** have auto insurance
- Covers:
  - Bodily injury liability
  - Property damage liability
  - Accident benefits
  - Collision/comprehensive

> 💡 **2026 Example:** Minimum liability varies by province - $200,000 in Alberta, but experts recommend $1-2 million coverage.

### 2️⃣ Property Insurance 🏠

Covers physical property against damage or loss.

| Type | What It Covers |
|------|----------------|
| **Personal Property** | Your home, condo, rental unit |
| **Commercial Property** | Office buildings, manufacturing facilities |
| **Contents** | Equipment, inventory, personal belongings |

> 💡 **2026 Example:** Fire damage to your home, burst pipes, theft, vandalism, hail damage.

### 3️⃣ Liability Insurance ⚖️

Protects you if you're **legally responsible** for causing injury or damage to someone else.

- Also called the **"casualty"** part of P&C
- Covers legal defense costs, settlements, and judgments

> 💡 **2026 Example:** Someone slips on a wet floor in your store, hits their head, and sues you - liability insurance covers this.

#### B) Mutual Companies 🤝

|---------|-------------|
| **Ownership** | Policyholders are called "members" |
| **Objective** | Collect just enough to cover losses & operations |

> - **The Co-operators** - Co-operative owned by 46 member organizations

##### 4 Types of Mutual Companies:

| Type | Key Feature |

| **2. Cooperative** | Shareholders are insured, contribute capital, surplus paid based on contribution |
| **3. Factory Mutual** | Focus on fire insurance & prevention, strict requirements (sprinklers, alarms) |
| **4. Stock Mutual** | Assessment mutual that transformed to insure general public, fixed premiums |

### 3️⃣ Captive Insurers 🔒

**Wholly owned and controlled by the insureds themselves.**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Ownership** | The companies being insured own it |
| **Purpose** | Self-insurance for large/related companies |
| **Operation** | Acts like traditional insurer but serves only its owners |
| **Benefits** | Customize coverage, retain profits, manage own risks |

> 💡 **Example:** Air Canada could create its own captive insurer instead of buying from Intact - they insure themselves and keep any profits.

> 📍 **2026 Canada:** Most Canadian-owned captives are domiciled in Barbados/Bermuda. British Columbia and Alberta have domestic captive legislation.
