> **Timestamp:** ~45:10 - 53:00 in the video

This section covers **the complete lifecycle of an insurance policy** - from application through claims, plus the factors that affect pricing and availability.

---

## 🎯 The Big Picture

> 🎯 **Plain English:** An insurance policy isn't just "buy and forget." There's a whole lifecycle - from application to claims to ongoing support. Understanding each stage helps you serve clients better and explains why different insurers work differently.

---

## 🔄 The Policy Lifecycle (5 Stages)

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Within the life cycle of an insurance policy, there's a couple things that happen. So they first start with an application process. That gets sent to the underwriter who then runs an underwriting process. If the quote is issued and accepted by the client, then it goes on to policy issuance. Once the policy has been issued, a client might request policy changes throughout the term of the policy. If they have a claim, then there's a claim process that happens. And then of course any ongoing customer support if a customer has any questions about their insurance policy."

## 📋 Stage 1: Application Process

> 💡 **From Screenshot:** "Application Process: Traditional insurer, Digital insurers quotes/approvals, Broker-assisted"

### 3 Types of Application Processes:

---

### 1️⃣ Traditional Insurer (Paper/Manual)

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "When it comes to working with more traditional or mainstream insurers, a lot of them will require detailed paper applications and in-person meetings. Nowadays, it might happen over email, but typically it involves filling out an application form, maybe in PDF format, sending it to the insurance company underwriter, and then they might call you or want to discuss the file."

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Application format** | Paper or PDF forms |
| **Communication** | In-person meetings, phone calls, email |
| **Process** | Fill out → send to underwriter → discuss by phone |
| **Speed** | Slower - requires back-and-forth |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Old-school method: fill out a paper/PDF form, email it to the underwriter, and wait for them to call you to discuss. Works but takes time.

---

### 2️⃣ Digital Insurers (Online Quotes/Approvals)

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Nowadays, a lot of underwriters or insurers are going through more of a digital process. Some of them will offer online applications through their portals or through some self-serve e-commerce platforms that provide instant quotes and approvals. Oftentimes, you can log into an insurance company's portal, type in the information, and they would give you a quote instantly. And then if you like it, you can go and bind it or make it effective directly on the platform without ever having to speak with anybody. So this is a very efficient process."

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Application format** | Online portal, e-commerce platform |
| **Communication** | No phone calls needed |
| **Process** | Log in → enter info → instant quote → bind online |
| **Speed** | Fast - instant quotes and binding |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Modern method: log into their website, type in the info, get a quote in 30 seconds, click "bind" - DONE. No talking to anyone!

---

### 3️⃣ Broker-Assisted

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "There's also broker assisted applications. When brokers can assist clients in completing applications and then submitting to the insurance companies. So if you're working with somebody who maybe English isn't their first language or is a more complicated commercial risk, you might want to sit down with a client and then help them fill out the application forms. Whether they're online, on paper, in a PDF format, whatever the case might be, you could help your clients with that if need be."

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Who does it** | Broker helps client |
| **When to use** | Complex risks, language barriers |
| **Methods** | Online, paper, PDF - broker guides client |
| **Benefit** | Ensures accuracy, better client experience |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** You sit down with the client and help them fill out the form. Especially important for:
> - English as second language clients
> - Complex commercial risks
> - Elderly or tech-challenged clients

---

## 🔍 Stage 2: Underwriting Process

> 💡 **From Screenshot:** "Underwriting Process: Manual, Automated, Hybrid"

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Once you have that application done, it gets sent on to the insurance company. Then they do what's called an underwriting process."

### 3 Types of Underwriting:

---

### 1️⃣ Manual Underwriting

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "They can do manual underwriting, where an underwriter conducts a detailed manual review of the application information. This is often used for complex or larger risks where they really want to make sure they're careful doing it right."

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Who does it** | Human underwriter |
| **Process** | Detailed manual review |
| **When used** | Complex or larger risks |
| **Speed** | Slower - thorough review |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** A real person reads every detail of your application, thinks about the risk, and makes a decision. Used when stakes are high (big commercial risks, unusual properties).

---

### 2️⃣ Automated Underwriting

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "For more run of the mill or mainstream risks, they can use something called automated underwriting where they will use algorithms to assess the risk and quickly determine premiums. This would be the case if you were going through a portal or you were going through an e-commerce option."

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Who does it** | Computer algorithms |
| **Process** | Automatic risk assessment |
| **When used** | Standard/mainstream risks |
| **Speed** | Fast - instant or near-instant |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** A computer looks at your info, runs it through formulas, and spits out a price. This is why you can get quotes online in 30 seconds - no human involved!

---

### 3️⃣ Hybrid Underwriting (MOST COMMON!)

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "And lastly, there's a hybrid underwriting, which is the most common. It combines automated systems with manual review for certain cases. So an underwriter might put the application through an automated system and it might have certain flags in there for the underwriter to review certain specific elements."

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Who does it** | Computer + human |
| **Process** | Auto-screening with manual review of flagged items |
| **When used** | Most applications |
| **Flags** | Unusual risks, missing info, red flags |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** The computer does first pass - if everything looks normal, it approves automatically. But if something looks weird (claims history, unusual property, incomplete info), it flags it for a human to review. **Best of both worlds!**

---

### Summary: Underwriting Types

| Type | Speed | Used For | Human Involvement |
|------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| **Manual** | Slow | Complex/large risks | 100% human |
| **Automated** | Fast | Standard risks | 0% human |
| **Hybrid** | Medium | Most risks | Human reviews flags |

---

## 📄 Stage 3: Policy Issuance

> 💡 **From Screenshot:** "Policy Issuance: Immediate, Deferred"

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Once the underwriter has quoted it or declined it and you present the quotes that are available to the client, the client picks one and they seek binding. We move on to policy issuance."

### 2 Types of Policy Issuance:

---

### 1️⃣ Immediate Issuance

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Sometimes policies can be issued immediately upon approval and this is more common with digital or digitally advanced insurance companies with good digital systems."

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **When** | Immediately upon approval |
| **Who offers** | Digitally advanced insurers |
| **Format** | Digital policy documents |
| **Benefit** | Client has proof instantly |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Click "bind" and BAM - your policy documents appear on screen or in your email. No waiting!

---

### 2️⃣ Deferred Issuance

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Otherwise, depending on the company, it can be a deferred issuance where policies are issued after a certain review period. This is typical with more traditional insurers. They might take a bit more time with their processing department to actually issue the policies and send them to the broker for review."

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **When** | After review period |
| **Who offers** | Traditional insurers |
| **Timeline** | Days to weeks |
| **Process** | Processing department reviews → issues → sends to broker |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** The old-school way - you wait a few days (or weeks) for the policy documents to come through. In the meantime, you give the client a binder.

---

### Summary: Policy Issuance

| Type | Speed | Insurer Type | Client Gets |
|------|-------|--------------|-------------|
| **Immediate** | Instant | Digital insurers | Full policy right away |
| **Deferred** | Days/weeks | Traditional insurers | Binder now, policy later |

---

## ✏️ Stage 4: Policy Changes

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Once the policy has been issued, it's been sent to the client, they have their insurance policy, they go about their day. From time to time, they might come back and request some policy changes."

### 3 Ways to Make Policy Changes:

---

### 1️⃣ Self-Service Online

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "It can be completely self-service online, meaning the client can make changes directly to their policy through an online portal."

| **How** | Log into portal, make changes |
| **Examples** | Add driver, change address |
| **When available** | Digital insurers |

---

### 2️⃣ Broker-Assisted

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "It can be broker assisted, meaning they would contact the broker and their broker would help them handle any policy amendments and make them on behalf of the client."

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Who does it** | Broker on client's behalf |
| **How** | Client calls broker → broker handles change |
| **When to use** | Complex changes, client prefers service |
| **Your role** | Handle the change request |

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Who does it** | Client contacts insurer directly |
| **How** | Client calls insurer's 1-800 number |
| **Risk for broker** | You might not know about changes! |
| **Best practice** | Ask insurers to notify you |

---

## ⚠️ Stage 5: Claims Process

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "So they've had their policy, from time to time, they are going to have claims. Claims processes can be handled in a couple different ways."

### 3 Ways to Handle Claims:

---

### 1️⃣ Traditional Claims Process

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "The traditional way to do it is to submit a form either on paper or online and then wait for manual processing. Claims can be handled the traditional way which involves submitting paper forms and waiting for the insurance company or the adjusting team at the insurance company to manually process."

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **How** | Submit paper/online form |
| **Process** | Wait for manual processing |
| **Who handles** | Insurance company adjuster team |
| **Speed** | Slower - manual review |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Fill out a claim form, submit it, and wait for an adjuster to call you back. Could take days.

---

### 2️⃣ Digital Claims Process

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "With the digital claims process, clients can file and track claims online with some digital documentation."

> 🎯 **Plain English:** For your best clients, YOU handle the claim. You file it, you follow up with the adjuster, you keep the client informed. That's VIP service!

---

## 🤝 Ongoing Customer Support

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Brokers are there to offer personalized service and offer ongoing support to their clients. So the broker would advise the client, work with them, and if there's any changes that need to be requested by the insurance company, the broker can go and do that."

### Support Channels:

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Customer support can also happen through live chat or email, especially if the broker or the insurance provider is more digitally minded, they might have those systems available to provide immediate support. Large brokerages might have call centers, digitally minded brokerages might have live chat or email systems, there's all kinds of different ways that customers can interact with their insurance company via their broker."

| Channel | Who Offers |
|---------|------------|
| **Phone** | Everyone |

---

## 💰 Part 2: Factors Affecting Pricing, Eligibility & Availability

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "When it comes to eligibility, availability and pricing of insurance products, there are a lot of factors that play into it."

### 9 Key Pricing Factors:

---

### 1️⃣ Inflation

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Inflation can have a big impact on your cost. Rising costs and materials and repairs will lead to higher payouts for claims, prompting insurance companies to adjust premiums in order to maintain the desired level of profitability."

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **What happens** | Material and repair costs rise |
| **Result** | Higher claim payouts |
| **Insurance response** | Premiums increase |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If lumber costs double, so does the cost to rebuild a house after a fire. Insurers raise premiums to cover this.

---

### 2️⃣ Building Values & Construction

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Your building values also make a difference. Depending on the type of construction you have and the quality of the construction, high construction costs will lead to high premiums."

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **High-quality construction** | Higher value = higher premium |
| **Type of construction** | Frame vs brick vs steel matters |
| **Replacement cost** | More expensive to rebuild = more coverage needed |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** A mansion costs more to insure than a bungalow. A wood-frame house costs more to insure than brick (fire risk).

---

### 3️⃣ Location

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Locations also matter as well because certain locations will have a higher risk of loss than others. If you are near a body of water, you might have a higher risk of flood than if you were located on higher ground."

| Location Factor | Impact |
|-----------------|--------|
| **Near water** | Higher flood risk |
| **High ground** | Lower flood risk |
| **Urban vs rural** | Different theft/fire risks |
| **Fire station distance** | Response time matters |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** House by the river? Higher flood premium. House on a hill far from fire hydrants? Higher fire premium. Location matters!

---

### 4️⃣ Age & Condition of Building

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "The age and condition of the buildings matter as well because older buildings are typically more susceptible to losses than newer buildings, due to things like maintenance, the older electrical systems, the older plumbing systems, there's a lot of reasons why age and condition of the building would play a factor in how your policy is priced."

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Older buildings** | More susceptible to losses |
| **Old electrical** | Fire risk |
| **Old plumbing** | Water damage risk |
| **Deferred maintenance** | Problems waiting to happen |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** A 100-year-old house with knob-and-tube wiring is a fire waiting to happen. Higher premium!

---

### 5️⃣ Renovations & Upgrades

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Typically, if you've done some renovations and upgrades, this can be a good thing because say you've replaced all the electrical wiring, you've replaced all the plumbing. That means there's less likely to be a leak, but also that means that your building value has gone up and we need to insure for a higher limit, which would then of course cost the customer more."

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **New electrical/plumbing** | Lower risk = good! |
| **Higher building value** | Higher limit needed = higher premium |
| **Net effect** | Could go either way |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Renovations are a double-edged sword:
> - NEW systems = safer = lower risk
> - HIGHER value = more to insure = higher premium
>
> Overall, usually the risk reduction helps, but the value increase means you pay more.

---

### 6️⃣ Climate Change

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Climate change is also a big factor with more frequent or severe and unpredictable weather events like floods and wildfires. This can increase the frequency of claims, which leads to higher premiums and limited availability for coverage in high risk areas. So if you're in a very wildfire prone area, then certain coverages might be restricted or certain companies won't insure properties in those areas."

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **More frequent storms** | Higher claims |
| **Wildfires** | Some areas uninsurable |
| **Floods** | Premium increases |
| **Availability** | Some insurers withdraw from high-risk areas |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** California wildfires, BC floods, Fort McMurray - climate change is making insurance harder and more expensive in certain areas. Some insurers are just saying "no" to high-risk zones.

---

### 7️⃣ Global Events & Natural Disasters

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "Global events also play a big role. Any natural disasters and other large-scale events can significantly impact entire regions. So insurance companies might have to adjust premiums or even withdraw from areas that are deemed too risky. An increase in catastrophic losses will also increase the cost of reinsurance for the insurance company, which can lead to them limiting or restricting certain coverage."

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Natural disasters** | Entire regions affected |
| **Catastrophic losses** | Reinsurance costs up |
| **Result** | Premium increases, coverage restrictions |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** A major hurricane doesn't just affect the people who got hit - it affects EVERYONE's premiums because it costs the insurer (and their reinsurers) billions.

---

### 8️⃣ New Technologies

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "New technologies also play a big role. Advancements of things like self-driving cars or smart home security systems can influence risk profiles and potentially lead to lower premiums for those that adopt them. For example, when it comes to car insurance, a lot of insurance companies are automatically adding discounts if you have things like anti-theft systems or automatic braking systems installed in your vehicle. But conversely, new technologies can also create new risks like cyber attacks, which can introduce new coverage needs and impact pricing."

| Technology | Impact on Premium |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Anti-theft systems** | ✅ Discounts |
| **Automatic braking** | ✅ Discounts |
| **Smart home security** | ✅ Lower home premiums |
| **Cyber risks** | ❌ New coverage needed |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** 
> - **Good tech:** Alarm systems, auto-braking = discounts
> - **New risks:** Cyber attacks = need cyber insurance (new cost)

---

### 9️⃣ Fraud

> 💡 **From Transcript:** "And finally, fraud."

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Insurance fraud** | Increases costs for everyone |
| **Result** | Higher premiums across the board |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** When people fake claims or exaggerate losses, honest people pay more. Fraud costs the industry billions, and that cost gets passed on to everyone.

---

## 📊 Summary: 9 Pricing Factors

| # | Factor | Impact |
|---|--------|--------|
| 1 | Inflation | Rising costs = higher premiums |
| 2 | Building Values | More valuable = more to insure |
| 3 | Location | Near water/fire risk = higher |
| 4 | Age & Condition | Older = more risk |
| 5 | Renovations | Better systems but higher value |
| 6 | Climate Change | More claims, less availability |
