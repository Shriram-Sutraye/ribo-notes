> **Part of:** [Identifying Loss Exposures](./00-identifying-loss-exposures.md)

---

## The 4 Main Categories

| Category | What It Means | Example |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| **Physical** | Direct damage to property | Fire destroys a building |
| **Loss of Use** | Can't use property after damage | Store closed for repairs = lost sales |
| **Legal Liability** | Legally responsible for someone else's loss | Customer slips and falls → lawsuit |
| **Human Assets** | Loss of key people | Owner dies, business can't operate |

---

## 1️⃣ Physical Loss Exposure

**Definition:** The risk of direct, physical damage to property.

### Examples:
| Scenario | Property Affected | Cause (Peril) |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| 🏠 House fire | The home structure | Fire |
| 🚗 Car accident | Vehicle | Collision |
| 💧 Burst pipe | Flooring & furniture | Water damage |
| 🌪️ Tornado | Roof, windows | Windstorm |

### Real-Life Scenario:
> **Sarah's Coffee Shop**
> 
> A fire breaks out in the kitchen and destroys the espresso machines, furniture, and part of the walls.
> 
> **Physical Loss:** The damaged equipment and building = **Direct property damage**

---

## 2️⃣ Loss of Use Exposure

**Definition:** The financial loss when you **cannot use** your property after damage, even if the property itself isn't the issue.

### Also Called:
- Indirect loss
- Consequential loss
- Business interruption (for businesses)

### Examples:
| Scenario | Physical Damage | Loss of Use |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| 🔥 Kitchen fire | Stove destroyed | Restaurant closed for 2 weeks → lost revenue |
| 🏠 Basement flood | Carpet ruined | Can't rent basement apartment → lost rental income |
| 🚗 Car totaled | Vehicle destroyed | Need to rent a car while waiting for new one |

### Real-Life Scenario:
> **Sarah's Coffee Shop (continued)**
> 
> The fire from before means Sarah's shop is closed for 3 weeks while repairs happen.
> 
> - No customers = No sales
> - Still paying rent, utilities, employee wages
> - **Loss of Use:** All the money lost while closed = **Indirect/Consequential loss**

> 💡 **Key Point:** The fire didn't directly "burn" her income. But because she couldn't USE the property, she lost money. That's loss of use!

## 3️⃣ Legal Liability Exposure

**Definition:** The risk that you'll be held **legally responsible** for causing injury or damage to someone else.

### Types of Liability:
| Type | What It Covers | Example |
|------|----------------|---------|
| **Bodily Injury** | Physical harm to a person | Customer trips on wet floor, breaks arm |
| **Property Damage** | Damage to someone else's stuff | Your dog destroys neighbor's garden |
| **Personal Injury** | Non-physical harm (reputation) | Defamation, false arrest |

### Real-Life Scenario:
> **Sarah's Coffee Shop (again!)**
> 
> A customer spills hot coffee, slips on the puddle, and breaks their wrist. They sue Sarah for:
> - Medical bills: $15,000
> - Lost wages: $5,000
> - Pain and suffering: $10,000
> 
> **Legal Liability:** Sarah may be legally required to pay **$30,000** if found negligent.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Liability coverage protects you from paying these costs out of pocket!

## 4️⃣ Human Assets Exposure

**Definition:** The financial risk when a **key person** (owner, employee, partner) can no longer work due to death, disability, or departure.

### Who Are "Human Assets"?
| Human Asset | Why They Matter |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Business owner | Makes all key decisions |
| Key salesperson | Generates most revenue |
| Specialist/Expert | Has unique skills others don't |
| Partner | Contributes capital or expertise |

### Real-Life Scenario:
> **Sarah's Coffee Shop (one more time)**
> 
> Sarah is the only person who knows the secret recipes and manages supplier relationships. If Sarah suddenly dies:
> - No one knows how to make the signature drinks
> - Suppliers don't know who to contact
> - The business might fail
> 
> **Human Asset Loss:** Sarah herself was a key asset to the business.

### Insurance Solutions:
| Solution | What It Does |
|----------|--------------|
| **Key Person Insurance** | Pays the business if a key employee dies/disabled |
| **Buy-Sell Agreement** | Partners buy out a deceased partner's share |
| **Life Insurance** | Provides funds to family/business |

## 📝 Quick Summary Table

| Category | Question to Ask | Insurance Type |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Physical** | "Was something damaged?" | Property insurance |
| **Loss of Use** | "Can they still use it?" | Business interruption |
| **Legal Liability** | "Could they be sued?" | Liability insurance |
| **Human Assets** | "Who is irreplaceable?" | Key person / Life insurance |

**Answer: d) Human Assets**

The bakery didn't burn down (not physical). It wasn't damaged (not loss of use). No one was sued (not liability). The owner — a **human asset** — was lost, and with them, the ability to run the business.
