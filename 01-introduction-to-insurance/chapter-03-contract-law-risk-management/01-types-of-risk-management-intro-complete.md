## 🎯 The Big Picture

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Before you can sell insurance, you need to understand what problems your client could face. This section teaches you the THREE types of risk (personal, property, liability), which risks are insurable (pure risk only!), and the 5 steps to manage risk properly.

---

## 📊 Part 1: Three Types of Risk

> 💡 **From Transcript (0s-14s):** "In order to properly perform risk management, you need to understand the types of risk that a client can be exposed to. In general, there are three types, personal risk, property risk, and liability risk."

### Overview:

| Type | What It Is |
|------|------------|
| **Personal Risk** | Financial hardship to the PERSON |
| **Property Risk** | Damage to tangible THINGS |
| **Liability Risk** | Causing harm to OTHERS |

---

### 1️⃣ Personal Risk

> 💡 **From Transcript (20s-33s):** "Personal risk refers to financial hardships to the person due to accident, sickness, or death. For example, if you're injured in a car accident and you're unable to work, you might suffer a loss of income. That's an example of personal risk."

| What Causes It | Result |
|----------------|--------|
| Accident | Can't work |
| Sickness | Medical bills |
| Death | Loss of income |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Car Accident

| Scenario | Risk Type |
|----------|-----------|
| Injured in car accident | Personal risk |
| Unable to work | Loss of income |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If YOU get hurt and can't earn money, that's personal risk. It's about YOUR body, YOUR health, YOUR ability to work.

---

### 2️⃣ Property Risk

> 💡 **From Transcript (36s-57s):** "Next we have property risk, which is risk of damage or destruction of tangible property. The more property you have, naturally, the more risk you face. For example, if you own multiple buildings, you have more assets, more property that is at risk of things like fire, earthquake, or flood."

| Definition | Damage or destruction of TANGIBLE property |
|------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **More property = More risk** | Simple math! |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Multiple Buildings

| Scenario | Risk Type |
|----------|-----------|
| Own multiple buildings | Property risk |
| At risk of fire, earthquake, flood | More assets = more exposure |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** The more STUFF you own, the more stuff you can LOSE. Someone with 10 buildings has 10x the property risk of someone with 1.

---

### 3️⃣ Liability Risk

> 💡 **From Transcript (57s-77s):** "And lastly, we have liability risk. This is risk that comes out of actions of individuals or businesses that can result in injury or damage to others. For example, if you're driving a car, you face liability risk in the sense that you might accidentally hit somebody."

| Definition | Risk from YOUR actions harming OTHERS |
|------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Source** | Actions of individuals or businesses |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Driving

| Scenario | Risk Type |
|----------|-----------|
| Driving a car | Liability risk |
| Might hit somebody | You cause injury to others |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If YOUR actions cause harm to SOMEONE ELSE, that's liability risk. You're RESPONSIBLE for fixing what you broke.

---

## 📊 Summary: 3 Types of Risk

| Type | About | Example |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Personal** | YOU getting hurt | Car accident, can't work |
| **Property** | YOUR STUFF getting damaged | Building burns down |
| **Liability** | YOU hurting OTHERS | You hit someone while driving |

---

## 💰 Part 2: Financial Risk (Pure vs Speculative)

> 💡 **From Transcript (115s-152s):** "Another common type of risk is called financial risk. With financial risk, we can break it down into two types. Speculative risk and pure risk."

### The Two Types:

| Type | Definition | Insurable? |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Pure Risk** | You can ONLY lose | ✅ YES |
| **Speculative Risk** | You might win OR lose | ❌ NO |

---

### Pure Risk (INSURABLE!)

> 💡 **From Transcript (124s-143s):** "When it comes to pure financial risk, that's a type of risk that you can only lose. For example, your risk of financial loss in the case of a fire is an example of a pure risk because if a fire happens, you can only lose. There's no gaining from this fire. So pure risk is the only type of risk that's insurable."

| Pure Risk | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Definition** | You can ONLY lose - no upside |
| **Example** | Fire - you can ONLY lose, no gain |
| **Insurable?** | ✅ YES - this is what insurance is for! |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Fire

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Fire happens | You can ONLY lose |
| No benefit from fire | Pure risk |
| **Insurable?** | ✅ YES |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** A fire only makes things worse - you never "win" from a fire at your business. That's pure risk, and insurance covers it.

---

### Speculative Risk (NOT INSURABLE!)

> 💡 **From Transcript (143s-160s):** "The second type is speculative risk where you might win or you might lose. Gambling or investing in the stock market is an example of a speculative risk. Usually you won't be able to buy insurance for these types of risks."

| Speculative Risk | Explanation |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Definition** | You might WIN or you might LOSE |
| **Examples** | Gambling, stock market |
| **Insurable?** | ❌ NO - not what insurance is for |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Gambling/Stock Market

| Scenario | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Stock market | Might win OR lose |
| Gambling | Might win OR lose |
| **Insurable?** | ❌ NO |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** The stock market can go UP or DOWN. You knew the risk when you invested. Insurance doesn't cover your gambling losses!

---

## 📊 Summary: Pure vs Speculative

| Type | Outcome | Example | Insurable? |
|------|---------|---------|------------|
| **Pure** | Only lose | Fire, theft, accident | ✅ YES |
| **Speculative** | Win or lose | Gambling, stocks | ❌ NO |

> 🎯 **KEY EXAM POINT:** Only PURE risk is insurable!

---

## 🎯 Part 3: Risk Management Goal

> 💡 **From Transcript (160s-189s):** "The goal of risk management is to reduce the financial consequences of the loss or reduce the probability of loss happens in the first place. One of the main jobs of risk management is to weigh the cost of the loss versus cost of protection and then finding the cheapest option. So for certain serious losses, it would make sense to invest more into protecting against it, whereas for smaller losses like shoplifting, it may not be worth the investment to protect it."

### Two Goals:

| Goal | How |
|------|-----|
| **Reduce consequences** | Minimize damage when loss occurs |
| **Reduce probability** | Stop losses from happening |

### Cost vs Protection:

| Loss Type | Protection Worth It? |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Serious losses** | ✅ Yes - invest in protection |
| **Small losses (shoplifting)** | ❌ Maybe not worth it |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Weigh the cost of insurance vs. the cost of the loss. For small stuff like shoplifting, maybe just accept the loss. For big stuff like fire, definitely get insurance!

---

## 👔 Broker's Role in Risk Management

> 💡 **From Transcript (190s-218s):** "As a broker, what's our job? Our job is to guide clients on the best protection. So that includes certain risk management techniques but also insurance as well. To do this effectively, you really need to understand your clients' risks. The insurance products that you have as well as any alternatives. For example, instead of or in addition to selling the cyber insurance policy, you can recommend that they back up certain important files on a regular basis."

### What Brokers Do:

| Task | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Guide clients** | On best protection |
| **Recommend insurance** | AND risk management techniques |
| **Understand risks** | Know your client's exposures |
| **Know products** | What insurance is available |
| **Know alternatives** | Non-insurance solutions |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Cyber Insurance Alternative

| Scenario | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Cyber risk | Cyber insurance policy |
| **Alternative** | Regular backups of important files |
| **Best approach** | BOTH! Insurance + backups |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** A good broker doesn't just sell insurance - they also suggest practical solutions like "back up your files regularly" in addition to cyber insurance.

---

## 🏢 Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)

> 💡 **From Transcript (217s-237s):** "For certain large companies, they might also practice what's called enterprise risk management. That's where they have an individual or a team of individuals whose job it is to reduce the impact of losses. They would look at strategic, financial and operational risks and then figure out how to manage them."

| What is ERM? | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **Who uses it** | Large companies |
| **Who does it** | Dedicated individual or team |
| **What they do** | Reduce impact of losses |
| **Risks covered** | Strategic, financial, operational |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Big companies like Air Canada or banks have entire TEAMS dedicated to managing risk. That's ERM.

## 📋 Part 4: Five Steps of Risk Management

> 💡 **From Transcript (77s-108s, repeated at 237s-267s):** "When it comes to risk management, there are five critical steps. The first is to ID, so identify any exposures that might affect your client. The second step is to analyze, analyze the risks that you've identified. The third step is to select the best risk management techniques possible to address those risks and exposures you've identified. The fourth step is to implement the chosen technique and finally to monitor the results and then modify your risk management techniques where necessary."

### The 5 Steps:

| Step | Action | What It Means |
|------|--------|---------------|
| **1. ID** | Identify | Find all exposures that affect client |
| **2. Analyze** | Analyze | Evaluate the risks identified |
| **3. Select** | Select | Choose best risk management technique |
| **4. Implement** | Implement | Put the chosen technique in place |
| **5. Monitor** | Monitor | Watch results, modify as needed |

```
5 STEPS OF RISK MANAGEMENT:

1️⃣ IDENTIFY → What could go wrong?
        ↓
2️⃣ ANALYZE → How bad would it be?
        ↓
3️⃣ SELECT → What's the best solution?
        ↓
4️⃣ IMPLEMENT → Put it in place
        ↓
5️⃣ MONITOR → Did it work? Adjust if needed
        ↓
     (Loop back to Step 1 - ongoing process!)
```

> 🎯 **Memory Hook:** **I.A.S.I.M.** = Identify, Analyze, Select, Implement, Monitor

---

## 🔍 Part 5: Step 1 - Identify Exposures (Deep Dive)

> 💡 **From Transcript (275s-329s):** "So the first step in the risk management process is to identify exposures. You would do that by making observations about the business or by having the customer or the client complete certain questionnaires."

### How to Identify Exposures:

| Method |
|--------|
| Make observations about the business |
| Have client complete questionnaires |

---

### Three Elements of a Loss Exposure

> 💡 **From Transcript (287s-329s):** "When it comes to a loss exposure, there's really three elements of it. The first is the potential cause of loss or damage. So for example, it could be fire, cyber attack, theft, terrorist attack, something of that nature. The second thing you want to look at for a loss exposure are the financial consequences of an occurrence. So if this was to occur, what would the financial consequences be? How much money would we lose? How much damage would we sustain? And finally, what are the objects or items that are subject to loss? So what can be exposed to loss? If you own a building, your building could be exposed to loss to fire, earthquake, theft, different things of that nature."

| Element | What to Identify |
|---------|------------------|
| **1. Cause of loss** | Fire, cyber attack, theft, terrorist attack |
| **2. Financial consequences** | How much money would we lose? |
| **3. Objects/items at risk** | What can be exposed to loss? |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Building

| Element | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Cause | Fire, earthquake, theft |
| Consequence | Building damage, loss of contents |
| Object at risk | The building itself |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** For every risk, ask: WHAT could happen? How much would it COST? And WHAT could be damaged?

---

## 📊 Risk Inventory (For Commercial Risks)

> 💡 **From Transcript (329s-392s):** "When it comes to commercial risks to help you identify the different exposures, you would run what's called a risk inventory to check for the loss frequency and severity. So this inventory would involve completing things like risk assessment surveys, examining the loss history of the business, looking at their financial statements, accounting records, work charts, as well as engaging consultants and other parties to help you."

### What's in a Risk Inventory?

| Tool | What It Shows |
|------|---------------|
| **Risk assessment surveys** | Formal risk questionnaires |
| **Loss history** | Past claims and losses |
| **Financial statements** | Cash flow, stability |
| **Accounting records** | Key financial data |
| **Work charts** | Organizational structure |
| **Consultants** | Expert opinions |

---

### Why Each Matters:

> 💡 **From Transcript (354s-392s):** "The loss history is important because you can see historically what types of losses the business has sustained. Perhaps there is one key individual in the work chart that's responsible for making decisions. If something were to happen to them, this could have a big bad impact on the business. If you look through them and you find out that they don't have a very strong cash flow, they may not be able to absorb a risk that well. Or if they rely primarily on one or two key customers, if something were to happen to those customers, that would also negatively impact the business."

| What to Check | Why It Matters |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Loss history** | Past losses predict future losses |
| **Key individuals** | One person leaving = big impact |
| **Cash flow** | Weak cash flow = can't absorb losses |
| **Key customers** | Losing 1-2 key customers = disaster |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** If the business depends on ONE key person or ONE big customer - that's a HUGE risk. If they don't have much cash, they can't handle losses. All red flags!

---

## 🎯 Part 6: Pre-Loss and Post-Loss Objectives

> 💡 **From Transcript (392s-406s):** "Now when it comes to identifying loss exposures and putting a risk management plan in place, you have two objectives. You have pre-loss objectives, which are goals that you want to hit before a loss occurs and post-loss objectives."

| Type | When | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| **Pre-loss objectives** | BEFORE a loss | Prevent or prepare |
| **Post-loss objectives** | AFTER a loss | Recover and survive |

---

### Pre-Loss Objectives (4 Goals)

> 💡 **From Transcript (406s-462s):** "When it comes to the pre-loss objectives, the number one thing is to manage your risk tolerance. Really understand what the risk tolerance of the business and what the owner is. If they are more wealthy, they have more cash flow, they might be more able to tolerate risk. It's also a personality thing. Certain owners or certain people are just less tolerant to risk than others."

| # | Pre-Loss Objective | Details |
|---|-------------------|---------|
| 1 | **Manage risk tolerance** | Understand owner's comfort with risk |
| 2 | **Cost-effective program** | Meets budget |
| 3 | **Comply with regulations** | E&O insurance for brokers! |
| 4 | **Enhance public image** | Focus on life/safety over finances |

### 📋 Transcript Example: E&O Insurance

> 💡 **From Transcript (439s-449s):** "For example, for insurance brokers, a key part of our risk management and also our regulatory requirement is to carry errors and omissions insurance when we do business."

| Example |
|---------|
| Insurance brokers MUST carry E&O insurance |
| It's both risk management AND regulatory requirement |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** Before anything bad happens, figure out: How much risk can the client handle? What's required by law? And always prioritize people over profits!

---

### Post-Loss Objectives (5 Goals)

> 💡 **From Transcript (462s-536s):** "After a loss, what are we focused on? We're focused primarily on the survival of the organization. We want to make sure that the organization can continue to operate and continue to deliver its services."

| # | Post-Loss Objective | Details |
|---|---------------------|---------|
| 1 | **Survival** | Organization continues to exist |
| 2 | **Minimal interruption** | Keep operating |
| 3 | **Stable earnings** | Protect cash flow |
| 4 | **Maintain growth rate** | Recover and grow |
| 5 | **Social responsibility** | Clean up, help community |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Factory Loss

> 💡 **From Transcript (480s-496s):** "So let's say we've lost one of our factories. Okay, let's see if we can continue to operate with rented equipment. Maybe we can, we have a backup factory that we can funnel a lot of the work to."

| Scenario | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Lost a factory | Rent equipment |
| | Use backup factory |
| | Funnel work to other locations |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Pollution Cleanup

> 💡 **From Transcript (524s-536s):** "For example, if there's a pollution incident, we want to make sure we're cleaning that up."

| Social Responsibility |
|----------------------|
| Pollution incident → Clean it up! |
| Protect community and employees |

> 🎯 **Plain English:** After a loss: SURVIVE first, then get back to normal ASAP, protect your income, keep growing, and be a good neighbor!
