## 🎯 The Big Picture

> 💡 **From Transcript (0.0s-22.5s):** "So we've talked about personal property now we go into commercial property. Commercial property is defined as any property that's owned or used by a business and it typically only provides coverage while that property is on the premises."

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Personal property = your home and stuff. Commercial property = your business and its stuff. Key difference: commercial coverage usually ONLY works at your business location (premises).

---

## 🏢 What is Commercial Property?

| Commercial Property |
|--------------------|
| Property owned or used by a business |
| Coverage typically on premises only |
| Three types: Building, Stock, Equipment |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> If you run a bakery, your "commercial property" includes:
> - The bakery building
> - Your inventory (flour, sugar, bread)
> - Your equipment (ovens, mixers, display cases)
> 
> Coverage only works AT THE BAKERY, not when you're delivering bread in your van.

## 📊 Two Types of Commercial Risks (0:27 - 2:22)

> 💡 **From Transcript (26.98s-53.18s):** "Commercial property is generally broken down into three types which will define later. We have building, stock, and equipment. When it comes to insuring commercial property risks, we break them down into two types. You have small risks and large, more complex risks. So small risks typically involve some limited exposures and typically in package policy here would be the most effective method to ensure them as far as efficiency and cost."

### Small Risks

| Small Risks |
|-------------|
| Limited exposures |
| Package policy = most effective |
| Efficient and cost-effective |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> A small coffee shop = small risk. You buy a pre-made "package" that includes everything you need (like a combo meal at a restaurant).

---

### Underwriting Small Risks

> 💡 **From Transcript (53.18s-70.86s):** "When it comes to underwriting small risks, you need to assess the client's needs and ensure that there are no gaps from the package policy. So you have to find a package that's the most suitable. When it comes to package policies, premiums are very easy to determine, coverage is typically brought and adequate enough for most risks."

| Package Policy Benefits |
|------------------------|
| Premiums easy to determine |
| Coverage is broad & adequate |

---

### ⚠️ Package Policy Downside: Lack of Standardization

> 💡 **From Transcript (70.86s-109.38s):** "The downside to utilizing package policies is that it lacks standardization. So for example, if you're looking to insure a trades and contractor, there might be a package policy that's available for them, which includes liability coverage and includes their property coverage. It includes equipment floaters for property that they take from site to site and neatly bundle together into a package. The problem is the terms and conditions of the package policy you get from insurance company A might be different than the one you get from insurance company B."

### 📋 Transcript Example: Trades Contractor Package

| Scenario |
|----------|
| Contractor gets package from Company A |
| Includes: liability + property + equipment floaters |
| Company B's package = DIFFERENT terms |
| **Cannot swap and assume they're the same!** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Two insurers can sell "Contractor Packages" that look similar but have DIFFERENT rules. Read the fine print! Switching from Insurer A to Insurer B ≠ same coverage.

---

### Large/Complex Risks

> 💡 **From Transcript (110.86s-135.1s):** "When it comes to large risks, those are typically more complex. And so we would individually write the policies and put it together into a package manually. So you might get liability insurance from one place. You might get some manufacturers, errors and omissions policy from another place. And their commercial property from one place and their commercial property floater from another place and put together a custom package for the insured."

| Large Risks |
|-------------|
| More complex exposures |
| Policies written individually |
| Custom package assembled manually |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Large Risk Custom Package

| Component | Source |
|-----------|--------|
| Liability insurance | Place 1 |
| Manufacturers E&O | Place 2 |
| Commercial property | Place 3 |
| Property floater | Place 4 |
| = Custom package | |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> A big factory needs custom coverage. You can't buy it "off the shelf." The broker shops around and builds a tailor-made policy from different insurers.

---

## 📜 Two Policy Forms (2:24 - 4:00)

> 💡 **From Transcript (140.78s-148.06s):** "With commercial property insurance, there's two policy forms you can choose from. You can get name perils or you can get broad form. With name perils, it covers only the perils listed."

| Form | Coverage |
|------|----------|
| **Named Perils** | Only listed perils |
| **Broad Form** | All risks NOT specifically excluded |

---

## 🔤 Named Perils: The FSWILLER Acronym (2:35 - 3:15)

> 💡 **From Transcript (151.42s-189.5s):** "A really good acronym I have to remember this is FSWILLER. F stands for fire. S stands for smoke damage due to the sudden and faulty operation of a stationary furnace. So that means not smoke coming from a heating or cooking device. W stands for wind storm and hail. I stands for impact by vehicles. L stands for lightning, including lightning damage to electrical devices. The other L stands were leakage from fire protective equipment. E stands for explosion of natural coal or manufactured gas, as well as boilers and pressure vessels, as long as they're under less than 15 psi of pressure. And our stands for riot or malicious acts."

### 🧠 FSWILLER Memory Trick

| Letter | Peril | Details |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **F** | Fire | Basic fire coverage |
| **S** | Smoke | From stationary furnace only (NOT cooking/heating devices) |
| **W** | Windstorm & Hail | Weather damage |
| **I** | Impact | By vehicles |
| **L** | Lightning | Including electrical device damage |
| **L** | Leakage | From fire protective equipment |
| **E** | Explosion | Natural/manufactured gas, boilers/vessels <15 psi |
| **R** | Riot | Or malicious acts |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> **F**ire, **S**moke (furnace), **W**indstorm, **I**mpact (car), **L**ightning, **L**eakage (sprinklers), **E**xplosion, **R**iot = **FSWILLER**
> 
> Think: "**F**ast **S**printers **W**in **I**f **L**ightning **L**ets **E**veryone **R**un"

---

## 📋 Broad Form Coverage (3:14 - 4:00)

> 💡 **From Transcript (194.14s-237.5s):** "The second policy form you can choose from is broad form. This one ensures all risks not specifically excluded by the policy. So the broader coverage is therefore more expensive. So for example, it covers things like vehicle impact caused by the insured's employees. After attempted theft, including property damage caused by theft. Water damage due to freezing or rupturing of pipes, but it still excludes flood, seepage, or sewer backup. Collapse of building is also covered, except collapse due to earthquake or faulty or improper work, material or designs. And the final coverage you get, which you don't get with name perils, is all sources of smoke damage. However, it excludes smoke coming from industrial operations such as agricultural smudging."

### Broad Form = Named Perils + More

| Broad Form Adds |
|-----------------|
| ✅ Vehicle impact by insured's employees |
| ✅ Attempted theft + property damage from theft |
| ✅ Water damage (freezing/rupturing pipes) — but NOT flood/seepage/sewer |
| ✅ Building collapse — but NOT earthquake/faulty work |
| ✅ All smoke sources — but NOT industrial/agricultural |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> **Named Perils** = only 8 things covered (FSWILLER)
> **Broad Form** = covers MORE but costs MORE
> 
> With Broad Form:
> - Your employee crashes into the building? Covered.
> - Thieves break in and damage stuff? Covered.
> - Pipe bursts? Covered (but NOT floods/sewer).
> - Roof collapses from snow? Covered (but NOT earthquake/bad construction).

## 💰 Rate Setting: How Premiums Are Calculated (4:04 - 6:03)

> 💡 **From Transcript (240.62s-260.06s):** "So now let's talk about how they set prices for commercial property insurance. The premiums they charge you are, of course, related to the coverage that you've chosen. The total rate per hundred dollars is the rate they need to charge you to ensure at hundred dollars worth of your property. The total rate is equal to your fire rate plus your loading."

### The Premium Formula

| Formula |
|---------|
| **Total Rate = Fire Rate + Loading** |
| Total Rate × Property Value = Premium |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> They figure out what to charge you for fire coverage first (fire rate). Then they add extra for other perils (loading). Multiply by your property value = your premium.

---

### What is the Fire Rate?

> 💡 **From Transcript (268.06s-282.78s):** "The fire rate is the basic rate they need to charge you to ensure at hundred dollars worth of your property against the perils of fire, lightning and explosion. There are five factors that affect your fire rate."

| Fire Rate |
|-----------|
| Basic rate for fire, lightning, explosion |
| Per $100 of property |
| 5 factors affect it |

---

### The 5 Factors That Affect Fire Rate

> 💡 **From Transcript (282.78s-353.42s):** "The first factor is building construction. A concrete building is cheaper to ensure than a wood frame building because it's more resistant to fire. They will also look at your claims history, both the claims history for your type of business and the claims history of the applicant himself or herself. It will look at your last five years. The third factor is protection against fire... Public protection means protection from outside sources... distance from a fire hydrant or fire hall... With private protection, that's protection installed by the applicant... sprinklers or alarms... The next thing they look at is occupancy... the type of business... And finally, it will look at your location... distance from other buildings..."

| # | Factor | What They Look At |
|---|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Building Construction** | Concrete = cheaper, wood frame = more expensive |
| 2 | **Claims History** | Business type history + your personal history (5 years) |
| 3 | **Protection (Public)** | Distance from fire hydrant/fire hall, water supply |
| 3 | **Protection (Private)** | Sprinklers, alarms (discounts available) |
| 4 | **Occupancy** | Type of business (yours AND neighbors) |
| 5 | **Location** | Area, distance from other buildings, crime rate, nearby building construction |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> **5 things that affect your fire rate:**
> 1. **What's it made of?** Concrete = safe. Wood = risky.
> 2. **Claims history?** Bad history (you or your industry) = higher rate.
> 3. **Protection?** Near a fire station? Have sprinklers? = discount.
> 4. **What business?** A restaurant (fire risk) costs more than an office.
> 5. **Where is it?** High crime area? Next to a gas station? = more expensive.

### Final Premium Calculation

> 💡 **From Transcript (354.38s-359.98s):** "So your total rate multiplied by your building value is how they calculate your final premium."

| Premium Calculation |
|--------------------|
| Total Rate × Building Value = **PREMIUM** |
