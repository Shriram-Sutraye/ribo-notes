# 📋 Commercial Property Insurance - Part 3
# Other Clauses, Property Away & Mechanical Breakdown

> **Timestamp:** 15:11 - 23:01 (910s - 1381s)

---

## 📜 Subrogation Clause (15:11 - 16:24)

> 💡 **From Transcript (911.66s-920.3s):** "Now let's talk about the subrogation clause. The subrogation clause allows the insurance company to sue the responsible party to recover any claims that they've paid to the insured. However, they will not subrogate against fellow insurers."

| Subrogation Clause |
|-------------------|
| Insurer can sue responsible party |
| To recover claims paid |
| Will NOT sue fellow insureds |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Insurance pays your claim, then goes after whoever caused the damage. If your neighbor's tree falls on your house, insurance pays you, then sues your neighbor.

---

### 📋 Example: You vs Guest Burns House

> 💡 **From Transcript (925.42s-944.3s):** "So let's say for example, you're cooking at home and you accidentally burn down your house. The insurance company would pay for your house, but they will not subrogate meaning they will not come back and sue you. However, I was at your house and I was cooking out being careless and I burned your house down. The insurance company would pay for your house and then they might come back and sue me if I was at fault."

| Scenario | Insurance Pays? | Will Sue? |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| YOU burn YOUR house | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (won't sue you) |
| GUEST burns your house | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (will sue guest) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You accidentally start a fire in your own home? Insurance pays, won't sue YOU. Your friend comes over, is careless, burns your house down? Insurance pays you, then SUES YOUR FRIEND.

---

### Net Recovery Split

> 💡 **From Transcript (945.819s-956.219s):** "If the net amount recovered in the lawsuit after costs have been paid, is not enough to fully cover the loss. The amount is divided between the insurance company and the insured based on the percentage of loss borne."

| Net Recovery |
|-------------|
| If lawsuit doesn't recover full amount |
| Split proportionally between insurer & insured |
| Based on % of loss each bore |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> The person who burned your house only has $50K. Your loss was $100K. Insurance paid $80K, you paid $20K (the deductible). The $50K is split: insurer gets 80%, you get 20%.

---

### Cannot Release Liability

> 💡 **From Transcript (956.219s-976.06s):** "The insured also cannot release anyone of liability. The insurance company will still sue that person. So let's say for example, I was at your house. I was cooking out being a little bit careless. I burned down the house. You can't just say, hey Jack, don't worry about it. We're not going to sue you. You cannot do that. The insurance company will still come and try to sue me and subrogate against me."

| Cannot Release Liability |
|-------------------------|
| You CANNOT tell the responsible party "I won't sue you" |
| Insurance company WILL STILL sue them |
| Your forgiveness doesn't stop subrogation |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your best friend burns your house. You say "Don't worry buddy, I won't sue you!" Doesn't matter—the insurance company CAN and WILL still sue your friend to get their money back. Your friendship doesn't stop their lawyers.

---

## 📜 Reinstatement Clause (16:21 - 16:37)

> 💡 **From Transcript (981.579s-997.42s):** "This basically states that the original amount of insurance is reinstated after the loss has been paid. So that means if you had $100,000 limit purchased in January, you had $5,000 loss in February. As soon as that losses paid, you still have $100,000. It doesn't go down to ninety five."

| Reinstatement Clause |
|---------------------|
| Original limit restored after claim |
| $100K limit → $5K claim paid → still $100K left |
| Does NOT reduce to $95K |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Think of your limit like a "refillable" bucket. You have $100K coverage. You claim $5K. After the claim is paid, your bucket is REFILLED back to $100K. You don't have $95K left—you have the full $100K again!

---

## 📜 Debris Removal (16:43 - 16:54)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1003.819s-1014.22s):** "So the insurance company will use the remainder of the limit, whatever's left after rebuilding or replacing your property to pay for the removal of debris."

| Debris Removal |
|---------------|
| Uses leftover limit after rebuild/replace |
| Pays for removal of debris |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Fire destroys your warehouse. Insurance pays to rebuild. After paying for the new building, whatever limit is LEFT OVER pays to haul away the burnt rubble and ashes.

---

## 📜 Property Protection Systems (16:54 - 17:42)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1014.22s-1040.619s):** "So you would be able to get discounts on your premium. If you have alarms, sprinklers, and other protection systems installed, if you do install these systems and you do claim that discount, there are some conditions. The insured must notify the insurance company immediately of any known interruption or defect in the protection system, as well as of any cancellation of monitoring or maintenance contracts or police services."

| Protection System Requirements |
|-------------------------------|
| Alarms, sprinklers = premium discounts |
| Must notify insurer IMMEDIATELY of: |
| - Any interruption or defect |
| - Cancellation of monitoring contracts |
| - Cancellation of maintenance contracts |
| - Cancellation of police services |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You got a discount because you have a burglar alarm. The alarm breaks. You MUST call your insurer RIGHT AWAY! If you wait and something gets stolen, they might not pay.

---

### Breach Consequences

> 💡 **From Transcript (1040.619s-1059.739s):** "If conditions are breached, three things can happen. The insurance company can reduce your coverage. For example, they can eliminate theft coverage until the system is repaired. They can charge an additional premium because now you're higher risk, or they can cancel your policy if the breach was intentional. This is because some businesses require protection before they become insurable. Examples include jewellery stores or banks."

| If You Breach Conditions |
|-------------------------|
| 1. **Reduce coverage** - e.g., no theft until repaired |
| 2. **Charge more** - higher premium for higher risk |
| 3. **Cancel policy** - if breach was intentional |

### 📋 Example: Jewellery & Banks

| High-Risk Businesses |
|---------------------|
| Jewellery stores |
| Banks |
| REQUIRE protection systems to be insurable at all |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> A jewellery store without an alarm and vault? NO insurance company will touch you. Some businesses are SO risky they MUST have security systems before insurers will even write a policy.

---

## 🚚 Property Away from Premises (17:42 - 19:42)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1062.54s-1084.3s):** "Now let's talk about some other commercial property forms. The first one I want to talk about is property away from the insured premises. If you remember with the regular commercial property the property must be on premises before it's covered. So with this one you will have coverage for property wealth in transit or at a temporary location as long as it's within Canada and US."

| Property Away from Premises |
|----------------------------|
| Standard commercial = only on premises |
| This add-on covers: |
| - Property in transit |
| - Property at temporary location |
| - Canada & US only |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Normal business insurance = only covers stuff AT your store. This coverage adds protection when your stuff is being SHIPPED or stored SOMEWHERE ELSE temporarily.

---

### In Transit Conditions

> 💡 **From Transcript (1085.74s-1095.1s):** "So if it's in transit there might be a condition that stipulates that the property be locked in the vehicle from start to end, including any incidental stops."

| In Transit |
|-----------|
| Property must be locked in vehicle |
| From start to end of trip |
| Including incidental stops |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You're shipping electronics. The truck must be LOCKED the whole way—even when the driver stops for lunch!

---

### Locked Vehicle Warranty

> 💡 **From Transcript (1095.1s-1118.22s):** "There might also be something called a locked vehicle warranty that is applied. It's commonly used if your property is very susceptible to theft or very valuable. This requires that the property be stored in a fully enclosed metal compartment locked doors and windows and there must be visible signs of forced entry that was used to gain entry to the compartment and steal something."

| Locked Vehicle Warranty |
|------------------------|
| For valuable/theft-prone property |
| Requires: |
| - Fully enclosed metal compartment |
| - Locked doors AND windows |
| - Visible signs of forced entry to claim |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Shipping diamonds? They MUST be locked in a metal box inside a locked vehicle. If stolen, you MUST show the thieves broke in (smashed window, pried door). If you just left the door unlocked? No claim!

---

### Common Carriers Exempt

> 💡 **From Transcript (1118.22s-1132.38s):** "Common carriers are excluded from complying with this warranty. So if you're shipping some goods that require a locked vehicle warranty if it's in the custody of a common carrier like Canada Post, they don't need to follow this warranty because of course some of the Canada Post or DHL trucks don't even have doors."

### 📋 Example: Canada Post & DHL

| Common Carriers |
|----------------|
| Canada Post, DHL = EXEMPT from locked vehicle warranty |
| Their trucks sometimes don't even have doors! |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You ship via Canada Post. The mail truck doesn't have a locked metal compartment. That's OK—shipping companies are exempt. The locked vehicle warranty only applies when YOUR vehicles carry the goods.

---

### Violation = No Coverage

> 💡 **From Transcript (1133.82s-1138.22s):** "A violation of the locked vehicle warranty if it applies will avoid all of your coverage."

| ⚠️ WARNING |
|-----------|
| Violate locked vehicle warranty = **ALL COVERAGE VOIDED** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Driver leaves the truck unlocked, stuff gets stolen? ZERO coverage. The locked vehicle warranty is STRICT.

---

### Property at Temporary Location

> 💡 **From Transcript (1140.06s-1156.7s):** "For property at a temporary location it covers property that's in the care, custody, and control of a bailee for higher at a location that's not owned rented or controlled by the insured. A bailee for hire is somebody who repairs goods, services them, stores them, or even at a carriers depot."

| Temporary Location |
|-------------------|
| Property in care of a bailee for hire |
| At location NOT owned/rented by insured |
| Bailee = repairs, services, stores goods |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You send your industrial printer to a repair shop. While the repair shop has it, it's covered under this policy. The repair shop = "bailee for hire."

---

## 🪟 Glass Insurance (19:23 - 19:42)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1163.02s-1175.9s):** "The second coverage I want to talk about is glass insurance. This covers accidental damage to glass by anybody by earth movements or by thieves. It excludes losses caused by fire or nuclear hazard. Fire is excluded because it's covered elsewhere. War and nuclear hazard are excluded because they're excluded everywhere."

| Glass Insurance Covers | Excludes |
|----------------------|----------|
| Accidental damage by anyone | Fire (covered by fire policy) |
| Earth movements | War |
| Damage by thieves | Nuclear hazard |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Someone throws a rock through your store window? Covered. Earthquake cracks your glass? Covered. Fire melts your windows? That's covered by your FIRE policy, not glass insurance.

---

## 📁 Valuable Papers & Records (19:41 - 20:12)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1175.9s-1203.66s):** "And finally we have valuable papers and records. This covers the cost to recreate these valuable papers and records if they're stored properly when not in use. The valuable papers means documents, records, drawings, books, maps, etc. It does not mean money or securities. And when I say stored properly I mean it must be stored in the described receptacle when not in use and while the premises is closed. That means you have to store it in a safe, a fireproof filing cabinet or something like that."

| Valuable Papers & Records |
|--------------------------|
| Covers: COST TO RECREATE documents |
| Includes: records, drawings, books, maps |
| NOT included: money, securities |
| Condition: Must be stored in safe/fireproof cabinet when not in use |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your irreplaceable architectural drawings get destroyed in a fire. This insurance pays to RECREATE them from scratch. BUT—they must be kept in a safe or fireproof cabinet when you're not using them!

---

## ⚙️ Mechanical Breakdown Insurance (20:12 - 23:01)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1212.62s-1229.34s):** "In other very common and very popular type of commercial property insurance is what's called mechanical breakdown insurance or formerly called boiler and machinery insurance. This covers the equipment breakdown of objects and objects meaning property that's owned, least operated or controlled by the insured."

| Mechanical Breakdown Insurance (MBI) |
|-------------------------------------|
| Formerly: Boiler & Machinery Insurance |
| Covers: Equipment breakdown |
| Objects = owned, leased, operated, or controlled |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Old name: "Boiler & Machinery." New name: "Mechanical Breakdown." It covers when machines break—boilers, A/C units, pumps, generators, etc.

---

### What MBI Covers

> 💡 **From Transcript (1229.34s-1279.659s):** "Aside from the actual breakdown of the objects themselves it also covers any building damage due to the explosion of boilers and press vessels and pressure vessels that are greater than 15 psi of pressure. As long as those vessels and boilers are controlled by the insured meaning their own least operated or controlled by the insured... It covers the breakdown of electrical or working mechanisms and some common losses you would see here are for things like bursting, cracking, arcing or general mechanical failure. Because it covers all property that's owned but also controlled by the insured it also covers property that's least and property not in storage."

| MBI Covers |
|-----------|
| Equipment breakdown |
| Building damage from boiler/vessel explosion (>15 psi) |
| Electrical/mechanical breakdown |
| Bursting, cracking, arcing, mechanical failure |
| Examples: boilers, A/C units, pumps, machinery |
| Leased property included |
| Property NOT in storage (equipment being used) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your commercial boiler explodes, damaging the wall. Covered! Your A/C compressor shorts out. Covered! Your industrial pump cracks. Covered! It covers machines that BREAK, not machines that just get old.

---

### What MBI Excludes

> 💡 **From Transcript (1307.82s-1313.74s):** "What it does not cover is things like deterioration, corrosion, wear and tear or the functioning of a safety device."

| MBI Excludes |
|-------------|
| Deterioration |
| Corrosion |
| Wear and tear |
| Functioning of a safety device |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your 20-year-old boiler is rusty and worn out? NOT covered—that's normal aging. But if it BREAKS unexpectedly? That's covered.

---

### 📋 Example: Safety Device Causes Damage

> 💡 **From Transcript (1314.38s-1330.94s):** "So if a safety device causes loss that's not covered. Say for example a piece of equipment overheats the safety device triggers a coolant to be sprayed or fire extinguisher to be sprayed and damages the equipment that would not be covered because it's due to the functioning of a safety device."

| Safety Device Example |
|----------------------|
| Equipment overheats |
| Safety device triggers coolant/fire extinguisher |
| Coolant damages the equipment |
| **NOT COVERED** (safety device did its job!) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your industrial oven overheats. The safety system sprays it with foam to prevent a fire. The foam ruins the oven. Is the oven covered? **NO**—the safety device WORKED correctly. It did what it was supposed to do!

---

### Insurer Inspection Rights

> 💡 **From Transcript (1337.1s-1349.34s):** "Typically when it comes to arranging the mechanical breakdown coverage the insurer will have the right to inspect the objects before and during the policy period. If they find a dangerous condition they can suspend the policy and reinstate once repairs have been conducted."

| Insurer Rights |
|---------------|
| Can inspect equipment BEFORE and DURING policy |
| If dangerous condition found → policy SUSPENDED |
| Reinstated once repairs completed |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> The insurance company can send an inspector to look at your boilers. If they find something dangerous, they can SUSPEND your coverage until you fix it. No coverage while something is dangerous!

---

### Optional MBI Add-ons

> 💡 **From Transcript (1349.34s-1372.7s):** "You can also get optional coverage to add coverage under the mechanical breakdown insurance for things like production machinery, also indirect coverage like business interruption or consequential damage like spoilage. For example if you had some frozen food stored in a industrial freezer and that broke down, yes the mechanical breakdown insurance would cover the freezer but you need consequential damage to cover the spoilage of the food inside."

| Optional Add-ons |
|-----------------|
| Production machinery |
| Business interruption |
| Consequential damage (spoilage) |

---

### 📋 Example: Industrial Freezer & Spoilage

| Freezer Breakdown |
|------------------|
| Industrial freezer breaks down |
| MBI covers: The freezer itself ✅ |
| MBI does NOT cover: The spoiled food ❌ |
| Need: Consequential damage add-on for food |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your giant commercial freezer breaks. Insurance replaces the freezer. But what about the $50,000 of frozen meat that spoiled? That's NOT covered unless you bought the "consequential damage" add-on!
