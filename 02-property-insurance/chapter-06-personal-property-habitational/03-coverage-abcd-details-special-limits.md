## 🏠 Part 9: Personal Property Settlement Basis (11:16-12:55)

> 💡 **From Transcript (702.12s-734.6s):** "When it comes to personal property it's again done on a replacement cost basis but certain items are only valid for actual cash value. So any fine art, antiques, or memorabilia would be paid for on an actual cash value basis because they're hard or impossible to replace by nature."

### Personal Property: RC vs ACV

| Settlement | When Applied |
|------------|--------------|
| **Replacement Cost** | Default for most items |
| **Actual Cash Value** | Fine art, antiques, memorabilia |

### Items Limited to ACV:

> 💡 **From Transcript (719.0s-734.6s):** "If you damage a Mona Lisa there is no replacement Mona Lisa right, it's a one-of-a-kind thing. Also if the property is not well maintained, it's no longer being used for its original purpose, for example if you have a laptop and now you're using it as a door stop, or if property is not replaced within 180 days."

| ACV-Only Items |
|----------------|
| Fine art |
| Antiques |
| Memorabilia |
| Property not well maintained |
| Property not used for original purpose |
| Property not replaced within 180 days |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Regular stuff (TV, couch, clothes) = Replacement Cost (you get a NEW one).
> Unique stuff (Mona Lisa, grandma's antique ring) = ACV only (because there's no replacement).
> Your old laptop you use as a doorstop = ACV only (it's not being used as a laptop).
> You have 180 days to buy a replacement, or you get ACV instead.

---

### 180-Day Replacement Option

> 💡 **From Transcript (735.32s-746.68s):** "So what you can do as an insured is you can opt for actual cash value first but then you have 180 days to change your mind back to replacement cost."

| 180-Day Rule |
|--------------|
| Can accept ACV first |
| Have 180 days to switch to RC |
| Must replace the item within 180 days |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Not sure if you want to replace that old TV? Take the ACV check now. If you change your mind and buy a new TV within 180 days, come back and they'll give you the difference to make it replacement cost.

---

### Media & Books of Account

> 💡 **From Transcript (746.68s-775.959s):** "When it comes to media, they only pay the cost to re-copy from duplicates so they won't pay you to actually recreate that media again. And for books of account they will only pay for the cost of blanks so buying those books again and then the cost to re-copy or transcribe. So again similar to media not the cost to actually recreate those records."

| Item | What's Covered |
|------|----------------|
| **Media** | Cost to re-copy from duplicates (not recreation) |
| **Books of Account** | Cost of blank books + cost to transcribe |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your family photos on a hard drive are destroyed. Insurance pays to copy them from a backup, NOT to hire someone to recreate them from memory.
> Your accounting ledgers are destroyed. Insurance buys you new blank books and pays to copy from backups, NOT to hire a forensic accountant to figure out what was in them.

## 🏡 Part 10: Coverage A - Dwelling Building (13:03-14:43)

> 💡 **From Transcript (783.56s-843.08s):** "Coverage A dwelling buildings, the limit of insurance you selected will cover the dwelling as well as any attached structures, for example the main house plus any attached garage or porches.

| Examples |
|----------|
| Swings |
| Tree houses |
| Sprinkler systems |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> If it's bolted down, cemented, or permanently attached to your yard, it's covered under Coverage A. Your kid's swing set? Covered. The sprinkler system in your lawn? Covered.

---

> 💡 **From Transcript (818.92s-829.64s):** "Any fixtures that are temporarily removed while in repairs or for seasonal storage, you're covered for up to 10% of your dwelling limit for these.

| Temporarily Removed Fixtures |
|-----------------------------|
| Limit: 10% of Coverage A |
| Must be for repairs or seasonal storage |
| Excludes obsolete items |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You take down the chandelier to repair it. It's sitting in your garage. Still covered (up to 10% of your house limit). But if you took it down 5 years ago and never put it back because you don't want it anymore, it's NOT covered.

---

### Materials & Supplies for Repairs

> 💡 **From Transcript (830.52s-848.68s):** "Any materials and supplies on premises if they're used in construction or for repairs are also covered but those used to build a new home are not. Theft is excluded while the building is under construction. It will only provide theft coverage when the dwelling is ready to be occupied, meaning it has left the construction phase."

| Materials Coverage |
|-------------------|
| Covered if for REPAIRS |
| NOT covered if for NEW construction |
| Theft excluded during construction |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Fixing your roof? The shingles in your driveway are covered. Building a brand new house? Those shingles are NOT covered. And no theft coverage until the house is move-in ready.

---

### Outdoor Swimming Pools

> 💡 **From Transcript (855.4s-860.84s):** "Any outdoor swimming pools and attached equipment, whether they are in ground or above ground are also covered. Examples include hot tubs."

| Outdoor Pools |
|---------------|
| In-ground pools ✅ |
| Above-ground pools ✅ |
| Hot tubs ✅ |
| Attached equipment ✅ |

---

### Outdoor Plants (5%, max $500/plant)

> 💡 **From Transcript (860.84s-873.319s):** "Outdoor plants are covered for 5% of your dwelling limit for up to $500 per plant. It covers you against fire, lightning, explosion, impact, riot, and vandalism. Note that it excludes coverage for wind storm and hail."

| Outdoor Plants |
|----------------|
| Limit: 5% of Coverage A |
| Max: $500 per plant |
| Covered: Fire, lightning, explosion, impact, riot, vandalism |
| **Excluded: Windstorm and hail** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your $800 Japanese maple is covered for $500 max. But NOT against wind and hail. If a windstorm kills it, you're out of luck. If a car crashes into it, you're covered.

---

## 🏚️ Part 11: Coverage B - Detached Private Structures (14:33-15:14)

> 💡 **From Transcript (874.6s-910.44s):** "Next you have Coverage B. Coverage B insures your detached private structures. These are structures that are separated from your main building by an open space. An example would be maybe a pool house or a detached garage. With this you have 10% of your coverage A limit. There is no need to specifically declare what detached structures you have because coverage is automatic."

### Coverage B Basics:

| Coverage B |
|------------|
| Detached private structures |
| Separated by open space |
| **Limit: 10% of Coverage A** |
| Automatic coverage (no declaration needed) |

### Examples:

| Detached Structure Examples |
|---------------------------|
| Pool house |
| Detached garage |
| Shed |

---

### Large Structures (>10% of Coverage A)

> 💡 **From Transcript (900.04s-910.44s):** "However if it's a large building and it's over 10% of the Coverage A limit then you need to note that on the policy. So if you have a pool house or something special like that that is over 10% of value of Coverage A then we need to insure that specifically."

| Large Structure Rule |
|---------------------|
| If >10% of Coverage A, must be declared |
| Insure specifically on the policy |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your house is worth $500K. Coverage B gives you $50K (10%) for detached structures. Your pool house is worth $80K? You need to tell the insurance company and add extra coverage!

---

## 🪑 Part 12: Coverage C - Personal Property (15:14-17:27)

> 💡 **From Transcript (919.0s-937.32s):** "Now let's talk about Coverage C personal property. You have coverage for your personal property while it's on premises, off premises, or the property of students. The limit of insurance for Coverage C is usually somewhere between 60 to 90% of whatever you've purchased for Coverage A."

### Coverage C Basics:

| Coverage C |
|------------|
| Personal property (your stuff) |
| On premises + Off premises + Students |
| **Limit: 60-90% of Coverage A** |

---

### On Premises Coverage

> 💡 **From Transcript (937.32s-967.16s):** "It only covers usual property meaning the stuff that's normally found in homes. Personal property can be defined as stuff that's owned or used by the insureds or for building maintenance. Property of others in the insured's custody is also covered if it's not covered elsewhere. For example if a friend leaves his laptop at your house and he doesn't have insurance and it gets damaged, your insurance will cover it. However it excludes property belonging to roomers and boarders."

| On Premises Coverage |
|---------------------|
| Usual property (normally found in homes) |
| Owned or used by insureds |
| Used for building maintenance |
| **Property of others** (if not covered elsewhere) |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Friend's Laptop

| Scenario |
|----------|
| Friend leaves laptop at your house |
| Friend has no insurance |
| Laptop gets damaged |
| **Your insurance covers it** |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your friend leaves their laptop at your house. Someone breaks in and steals it. If your friend has no insurance, YOUR home insurance covers their laptop. But your roommate's stuff? NOT covered—they need their own policy.

---

### Off Premises Coverage

> 💡 **From Transcript (967.4s-978.52s):** "You have global coverage for your property if it's temporarily off premises. For example if you take something with you on vacation."

| Off Premises Coverage |
|----------------------|
| Global coverage |
| Must be temporarily off premises |
| Example: Stuff you take on vacation |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You take your camera to Paris. It gets stolen. Your home insurance in Canada covers it because it was only "temporarily" away from home.

---

### Property of Students

> 💡 **From Transcript (978.52s-1003.319s):** "Even the property of students is covered if they're living away from home for school purposes although it might be subject to a limit. Coverage stops when they're no longer considered to be a student, maybe they've graduated, and there's usually special limits for things like theft."

| Student Property |
|-----------------|
| Covered if away for school |
| Subject to limits |
| Ends when no longer a student |
| Special limits for theft |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your kid's laptop at their college dorm is covered by YOUR home policy. But once they graduate and get a job, they need their own insurance!

---

### What's NOT Covered Under Coverage C

> 💡 **From Transcript (1009.319s-1062.04s):** "So motorized vehicles and the equipment, for example golf carts, cars, ATVs would be excluded. However domestic type vehicles are still insured. Domestic type vehicles meaning lawnmowers, wheelchairs meant for disabled people, things like that. Also excluded would be any personal property that's kept at another property that belongs to the insured, whether that's owned, rented, or occupied by the insured. Also excluded are outdoor trees, lawn, plants, as well as things being grown for commercial purposes."

| Excluded from Coverage C |
|-------------------------|
| Motorized vehicles (cars, ATVs, golf carts) |
| Aircraft & equipment |
| Campers, trailers & equipment |
| Property at another location you own/rent |
| Outdoor trees, lawn, plants |
| Commercial crops |

### What IS Covered:

| Still Covered |
|---------------|
| Lawnmowers (domestic) |
| Wheelchairs (disabled) |
| Spare car parts (spark plugs) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your CAR = NOT covered (get auto insurance).
> Your LAWNMOWER = Covered (it's for domestic use).
> Your PLANTS = NOT covered under Coverage C (they're covered under Coverage A with special limits).
> Your VACATION HOME stuff = NOT covered here (it needs its own policy).

---

## ⚠️ Part 13: Special Limits of Insurance (17:27-19:35)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1069.24s-1079.72s):** "Now let's talk about some special limits of insurance. So depending on whether your property is damaged by theft or any other peril, there could be special limits that apply."

### Special Limits: Any Insured Peril

> 💡 **From Transcript (1079.72s-1148.76s):** "If any of the following property is damaged by any insured peril, payment is restricted to the amounts I'm going to say."

| Property | Limit |
|----------|-------|
| **Business property** (tools, books of account) | $2,000 |

> - Your coins? Max $200.
> - Your jet ski? Max $1,000.
> - Your garden tractor? Max $5,000.
> - Your dog? Max $500 (and NO coverage if hit by a car).

---

### Special Limits: Theft/Loss Only

> 💡 **From Transcript (1148.76s-1168.2s):** "Now the following property if stolen or lost, payment is restricted to the amounts mentioned."

| **Card collections** | $1,000 |
| **Manuscripts & stamps** | $1,000 |
| **Bicycles & equipment** | $500 |
| **Coins or coin collections** | $200 |

> Your baseball card collection worth $5,000 is stolen? You get $1,000 max.
> **Want more?** Buy a jewellery/collectibles endorsement!

---

### Deductible on Special Limit Items

> 💡 **From Transcript (1168.2s-1172.28s):** "When it comes to applying deductibles on claims that are subject to a special limit, the limits will only apply if the losses are greater than the deductible."

| Deductible Rule |
|-----------------|
| Special limits only apply if loss > deductible |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> Your deductible is $1,000. Your $500 bike is stolen. The $500 bike limit doesn't matter because $500 < $1,000 deductible. You get nothing.

---

## 🛏️ Part 14: Coverage D - Additional Living Expenses (19:35-20:55)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1175.48s-1186.76s):** "Now let's talk about Coverage D additional living expenses. This covers your additional living expenses but also lost rental income."

### Coverage D Covers:

| Coverage D |
|------------|
| Additional Living Expenses |
| Lost Rental Income |

---

### Additional Living Expenses

> 💡 **From Transcript (1186.76s-1219.8s):** "It pays for any extra expenses you need to maintain your normal standard of living due to necessary relocation after your home is damaged by an insured peril. Examples of expenses that it would pay for include lodging, moving fees, meals if you can't cook at the new location, or kennel time for the family pets. It's important to note that this pays for ADDITIONAL living expenses only. If your food bill was $400 a month before and now you're staying in a hotel and spending $1,000 a month on meals because you can't cook in the room, the insurance company will give you the extra $600."

| Additional Living Expenses |
|---------------------------|
| Lodging (hotel, rental) |
| Moving fees |
| Meals (if can't cook) |
| Kennel for pets |
| **Only pays ADDITIONAL costs** |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Food Bill

| Scenario | Coverage |
|----------|----------|
| Normal monthly food bill | $400 |
| Hotel food bill | $1,000 |
| **Insurance pays** | $600 (the EXTRA) |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You're paying $400/month on groceries normally. Now you're in a hotel eating room service at $1,000/month. Insurance doesn't pay the full $1,000—they pay the extra $600 because you'd be spending $400 anyway!

---

### Fair Rental Value (Lost Rent)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1219.8s-1233.8s):** "This coverage will also pay for fair rental value, so this will pay you lost rental income because most residential tenants don't have to pay rent if the place is uninhabitable."

| Fair Rental Value |
|------------------|
| Pays lost rental income |
| Tenants don't pay rent if uninhabitable |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> You rent out your basement for $1,000/month. A fire makes it uninhabitable. Your tenant doesn't have to pay rent, but insurance pays you the $1,000/month you're missing.

---

### Civil Authority (2 Weeks)

> 💡 **From Transcript (1234.76s-1254.04s):** "If your home is undamaged but you're denied access by civil order due to a danger caused by an insured peril from outside the premises, the insurance company will pay you for up to two weeks. An example of this would be if there's an incoming fire and you're forced to evacuate. Of course fire is an insured peril for most policies."

| Civil Authority |
|-----------------|
| Home undamaged but access denied |
| Danger from OUTSIDE (insured peril) |
| Coverage: Up to **2 weeks** |

### 📋 Transcript Example: Wildfire Evacuation

| Scenario |
|----------|
| Wildfire approaching your neighborhood |
| Government orders evacuation |
| Your house is FINE but you can't go back |
| Insurance pays living expenses for 2 weeks |

> [!TIP]
> **Plain Dumb Down Version:**
> A wildfire is coming. The government says "Get out!" Your house isn't damaged, but you can't go home. Insurance pays your hotel bill for up to 2 weeks.
